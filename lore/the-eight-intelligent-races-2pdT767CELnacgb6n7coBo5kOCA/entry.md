These Eight races, including humans, form the foundation of Esnar’s intelligent civilizations. Each race is unique, contributing to the diversity, beauty, and complexity of the world. While humans may have started as the least regarded of the eight, the tapestry of the other races shows the incredible variety of strengths, flaws, and cultural nuances in Esnar's ecosystem.

**Vaarath** is the embodiment of divine fury, a storm given monstrous form. Unlike Shuthar's creeping hunger, Vaarath is an unstoppable force of destruction that annihilates everything in a blaze of fire and lightning. Its presence turns the skies black and red, and its every movement unleashes storms capable of leveling entire continents.

**Physical Description:** Vaarath takes the shape of a massive, dragon-like entity wreathed in perpetual flames and coursing with lightning. Its wings stretch across the horizon, trailing storms of ash and embers, while its eyes burn with the intensity of twin suns. Its roar is said to split the heavens, and its breath can turn oceans to steam.

**Abilities:**
- **Apocalyptic Storms:** Vaarath’s movements summon hurricanes, firestorms, and bolts of lightning that reduce entire regions to ashes.
- **Infernal Breath:** Its fiery breath melts through the strongest of defenses, leaving behind molten craters where cities once stood.
- **Chain Cataclysm:** Every strike from its claws or tail triggers seismic events, from volcanic eruptions to earthquakes, further spreading devastation.

**Symbolism:** Vaarath is a manifestation of mortal arrogance and the inevitable collapse brought on by hubris and pride. It serves as a reminder of the destructive consequences of unrestrained power.

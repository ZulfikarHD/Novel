Two hundred millennium ago, the world of Esnar, a sprawling realm of over 10,200 million square kilometers, teetered on the brink of annihilation. Its vast continents, teeming with diverse civilizations, were torn apart by endless wars and the unchecked ambition of its inhabitants. The 8 intelligent races of Esnar—renowned for their ingenuity, strength, and unique abilities—descended into chaos, waging conflicts that left even the heavens scarred. Amidst this turmoil, mortals dared to declare themselves gods. These self-proclaimed deities, drunk on forbidden magic and relics of unimaginable power, subjugated entire regions and sowed discord across the land. They sought to bend not only mortals but even the transcendent races—the Ethereals, Spirits, and Mythical Beasts—to their will.

The transcendent races, beings of extraordinary power tasked with maintaining balance in Esnar, looked upon the chaos with disdain. Instead of intervening, they withdrew to their sacred realms, deeming mortal conflicts beneath them. Their indifference only emboldened the self-proclaimed gods, who shattered ancient boundaries of magic and technology in their quest for supremacy. This hubris, combined with the relentless destruction wrought by mortal wars, plunged Esnar into what came to be known as the Age of Chaos—a period of unparalleled suffering that seemed to have no end.

It was then that the True God, silent for Aeon, intervened. In a display of divine wrath, a massive landmass erupted from the planet’s core, tearing apart continents and reshaping the geography of the world. From this scarred and newly formed terrain emerged Shuthar and Vaarath, two cataclysmic entities of unimaginable power, created as instruments of divine punishment. Shuthar, the Devourer of Flesh, was a grotesque colossus, a writhing amalgamation of sinew, teeth, and limbs that consumed everything in its path. Its every step left behind wastelands of corruption, spawning abominable creatures that spread terror across the land. Vaarath, the Storm of Eternal Fire, was a living tempest of flame and lightning, its wings darkening the skies as it unleashed torrents of destruction. Cities crumbled beneath its fiery wrath, and the air itself burned where it passed. These twin forces of annihilation, embodiments of divine judgment, set upon Esnar with an unrelenting fury, targeting not just mortals but also the self-proclaimed gods who had mocked the heavens.

For four harrowing years, Shuthar and Vaarath ravaged Esnar, reducing 70% of its surface to ash and barren wasteland. Over 7,140 million square kilometers became the Unknown Region, a lifeless expanse teeming with monstrous remnants of the devastation. Entire continents were consumed, their cultures and histories erased as the twin entities tore through the land. Even the once-proud self-proclaimed gods fell before the overwhelming might of Shuthar and Vaarath, their divine aspirations crushed beneath the weight of true power.

As the destruction spread, the remaining races of Esnar faced extinction. By the time only 30% of the world remained habitable, desperation forced the intelligent races to set aside their rivalries and seek aid from the transcendent races. The Ethereals, Spirits, and Mythical Beasts, recognizing at last the existential threat posed by Shuthar and Vaarath, descended from their realms to join the coalition. This fragile alliance, known as the Great Unification, brought together mortals and transcendent beings for the first time in history. Combining their knowledge and power, they devised Resonance, a ritual that bound the souls of two or more beings, amplifying their strengths and abilities. Resonance became the foundation of their resistance, with Resonators rising as champions of the coalition.

Despite the potential of Resonance, old prejudices lingered. Each race guarded its pride, and none were willing to form Resonance with humans. Viewed as weak, short-lived, and lacking unique abilities, humans were dismissed as burdens rather than allies. This division weakened the coalition, and even with the combined might of mortals and transcendence, the Great Unification failed to halt the onslaught. The remaining habitable land shrank further, dwindling from 30% to a mere 10% of Esnar’s surface—roughly 1,020 million square kilometers.

Amidst this despair, a nameless human stepped forward. Frail and unremarkable compared to the giants and magi around him, he was dismissed by many, but his courage and conviction could not be ignored. He stood before the gathered races, calling for unity in the face of annihilation. Though his words moved some, it was not until a Mythical Beast of immense power chose to resonate with him that his true potential was revealed. This Resonance, the first ever formed with a human, unlocked a hidden and unprecedented ability: the power of Omni-Resonance, which allowed him to form bonds with all races, transcending the usual limitations of Resonance.

With his newfound strength, the human forged connections among the disparate races, rallying them under a single banner. As the first Omni-Resonator, he became the heart of the coalition, using his bonds to inspire and empower others. Together, the coalition mounted a desperate defense of the remaining habitable land. Though they could not defeat Shuthar and Vaarath, they managed to halt their advance, protecting the last bastion of life in Esnar.

Then, as suddenly as they had appeared, Shuthar and Vaarath vanished. The reason for their disappearance remains a mystery. Some believe the True God, satisfied that the survivors had learned humility, recalled the twin entities. Others theorize that the Omni-Resonance disrupted their divine purpose, forcing them into dormancy. Whatever the truth, their departure marked the end of Judgment Day, though the scars of their rampage remain.

The Unknown Region, spanning more than 70% of Esnar’s surface, remains an inhospitable wasteland filled with monstrous creatures and corrupted landscapes. The remaining 10% of the world has become a sanctuary, rebuilt through cooperation and mana-driven innovation. Resonance has become a cornerstone of Esnar’s defense and exploration, its importance recognized across all races. Humans, once dismissed as insignificant, gained newfound respect for their unique potential, though the ability to perform Omni-Resonance has not been seen again.

The nameless human who first united the races is celebrated as a hero, his legacy immortalized in song and stone. His story serves as a reminder of the strength found in unity and the potential hidden within the weakest among us. Yet, even as Esnar rebuilds, the prophecy of Shuthar and Vaarath’s return looms over the world. Many believe they slumber, waiting for the world to repeat its mistakes. Should Esnar once again fall into chaos, the Devourer of Flesh and the Storm of Eternal Fire may rise to deliver their final judgment.

**Shuthar** is a grotesque monstrosity, embodying the insatiable hunger of destruction. Its massive, ever-shifting form is a writhing mass of tendrils, gaping maws, and churning flesh, constantly consuming everything in its path. Cities, armies, forests, and even mountains vanish into its depths, leaving behind barren, corrupted wastelands where no life can thrive.

**Physical Description:** Shuthar is an amorphous abomination, its size dwarfing the largest mortal constructs. Its "skin" glistens with a black, tar-like substance that seeps into the ground, poisoning the land. Its tendrils are covered in jagged barbs, and its many mouths constantly shift and gnash, emitting an otherworldly cacophony that shatters the morale of those who hear it.

**Abilities:**
- **Corruption Aura:** Shuthar's presence spreads a toxic aura that corrupts mana flows, rendering magic unstable or entirely ineffective.
- **Endless Consumption:** Everything Shuthar devours—living or inert—is broken down into pure destruction, feeding its endless hunger.
- **Spawn Creation:** From the mass of its own flesh, Shuthar spawns hordes of lesser monstrosities, abominations that spread its destruction further and terrorize survivors.

**Symbolism:** Shuthar represents the consequences of mortal greed and unchecked consumption, a living allegory for the devastation caused by the Age of Chaos.

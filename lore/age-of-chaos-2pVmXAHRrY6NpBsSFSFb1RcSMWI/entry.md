The **Age of Chaos** was a catastrophic period in Esnar’s history, spanning centuries of relentless conflict, unchecked ambition, and unparalleled destruction. It was an era when mortal greed and arrogance reached their zenith, plunging the world into darkness and setting the stage for divine intervention.

During this age, the 8 intelligent races of Esnar were embroiled in endless wars. Driven by territorial disputes, ancient grudges, and the pursuit of power, they ravaged the land with magic, technology, and raw force. Kingdoms rose and fell in the blink of an eye, and the landscape itself was scarred by their ceaseless battles. Alliances were fleeting, trust was scarce, and the idea of peace was but a distant memory.

Amid this chaos, certain individuals claimed godhood. These **self-proclaimed gods** were mortals who, through forbidden means, wielded powers rivaling the transcendent races. They raised armies, enslaved weaker nations, and carved out domains where they ruled with absolute authority. Their influence only deepened the rift between the races, as each sought to either ally with or destroy these false deities. The rise of these self-proclaimed gods marked a turning point in the Age of Chaos, as their hubris and cruelty further destabilized the already fragile balance of the world.

The transcendent races—Ethereals, Spirits, and Mythical Beasts—watched from their sacred realms. Tasked with maintaining balance in Esnar, they were expected to intervene. Yet, they chose to remain silent, withdrawing from mortal affairs. To them, the conflicts were a result of mortal folly, unworthy of their attention. This abandonment by the transcendents left the world vulnerable, with no higher power to mediate the growing unrest.

The wars during the Age of Chaos were not confined to the material world. Arcane experimentation, unregulated mana usage, and the overreach of magical power tore at the fabric of reality itself. Natural disasters became commonplace—mountains crumbled, oceans boiled, and the skies darkened with storms born of magical corruption. Entire ecosystems were obliterated, and regions of the world became uninhabitable.

It was during this period of unbridled destruction that the seeds of Resonance were planted. Desperate for survival, some races began experimenting with soul-binding rituals, discovering the potential to amplify their strengths through cooperative magic. However, in the Age of Chaos, such practices were often perverted into tools of domination rather than unity, further fueling the discord.

The Age of Chaos reached its climax when the wars grew so intense that even the heavens could no longer endure. The True God, unseen and unacknowledged for an Aeon, intervened. The emergence of **Judgment Day**, heralded by the arrival of Shuthar and Vaarath, marked the end of the Age of Chaos. These divine beasts were sent as punishments for mortal hubris, unleashing a level of destruction that dwarfed anything the world had previously endured.

The Age of Chaos was ultimately a lesson written in blood and fire. It was a time of immense suffering but also one of grim transformation. It forced the races of Esnar to confront their own flaws, leading to the eventual Great Unification and the development of Resonance as a tool for cooperation and survival. Though the Age of Chaos ended with Judgment Day, its legacy lingers, a haunting reminder of the cost of ambition and the fragile balance upon which the world rests.

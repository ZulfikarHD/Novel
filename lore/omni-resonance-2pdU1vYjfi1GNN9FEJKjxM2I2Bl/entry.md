Omni-Resonance is the rare ability to resonate with all races and beings, transcending the usual limit of three bonds. This capacity allowed the First Human Resonator to act as a unifying force, amplifying and harmonizing the diverse abilities of Esnar's alliance.

Through this power, the Resonator could bridge the gaps between the races, combining the agility of the Virdaliths, the strength of the Ferradin, the foresight of the Seraphii, and the light of the Auranites. Their presence not only increased the tactical strength of the allied forces but also inspired unprecedented cooperation.

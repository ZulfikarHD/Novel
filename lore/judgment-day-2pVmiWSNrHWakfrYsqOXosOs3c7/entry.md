**Judgment Day** was the cataclysmic conclusion to the Age of Chaos and a defining event in the history of Esnar. It marked the moment when the True God intervened directly to punish the mortal races for their unchecked ambition, relentless wars, and sacrilegious acts of hubris. Judgment Day was not merely a day but a four-year-long divine reckoning that reshaped the world forever.

It began with an unprecedented event: the violent emergence of a massive landmass from Esnar’s core. The eruption was so forceful that it fractured the world’s continents, forming deep chasms and altering ocean currents. This landmass, imbued with divine energy, became the birthplace of two apocalyptic entities—**Shuthar, the Devourer of Flesh**, and **Vaarath, the Storm of Eternal Fire**—twin manifestations of divine wrath.

Shuthar was a grotesque, living embodiment of consumption. Its immense body writhed with tendrils, teeth, and limbs that devoured everything in its path, leaving behind a barren, corrupted landscape. It spawned countless monstrous abominations, which spread terror and destruction wherever they roamed. Vaarath, in contrast, was a winged tempest of fire and lightning. Its every movement darkened the skies, and its destructive storms obliterated cities, armies, and even mountain ranges. Together, these two divine beasts wreaked havoc on Esnar, targeting not only mortals but also the self-proclaimed gods who had claimed dominion over the land.

Over four years, Shuthar and Vaarath ravaged Esnar with unrelenting fury. Their presence annihilated 70% of the world’s surface—over 7,140 million square kilometers—leaving behind the **Unknown Region**, a desolate, corrupted wasteland teeming with monstrous remnants of their wrath. Entire civilizations were erased, their knowledge and legacies lost to time. The remaining 30% of Esnar’s habitable land became a sanctuary for the survivors, who were forced to contend with the devastating loss of life and territory.

The destruction was so profound that the races of Esnar—previously divided by greed, pride, and prejudice—were compelled to unite for the first time. This fragile alliance, known as the **Great Unification**, included the 8 intelligent races and the transcendent races (Ethereals, Spirits, and Mythical Beasts), who finally chose to intervene. Together, they developed **Resonance**, a powerful soul-binding ritual that allowed them to amplify their strengths by forging connections across races.

Despite their newfound cooperation, the coalition struggled to stop Shuthar and Vaarath. The twin beasts were seemingly unstoppable, their divine power overwhelming even the combined might of mortals and transcendents. The coalition's efforts were further hindered by old prejudices and distrust, as many races refused to work with humans, dismissing them as weak and insignificant.

When the world’s habitable land dwindled to a mere 10%—approximately 1,020 million square kilometers—a pivotal moment occurred. A nameless human, frail and unremarkable, stepped forward to rally the coalition. Against all odds, a Mythical Beast of immense power chose to resonate with this human, marking the first-ever Resonance between a human and a transcendent being. This act revealed a hidden potential within humanity: the ability to perform **Omni-Resonance**, forging bonds with all races. With this newfound power, the human became a unifying force, inspiring others to set aside their differences and fight together.

Though even the might of the Omni-Resonator and the coalition could not defeat Shuthar and Vaarath, their combined efforts managed to halt the beasts’ advance, protecting the last bastion of life in Esnar. Then, as suddenly as they had appeared, the twin beasts vanished without warning. Their disappearance remains a mystery. Some believe the True God recalled them, satisfied that mortals had learned the value of humility and unity. Others speculate that the Omni-Resonator disrupted their divine purpose, forcing them into dormancy.

Judgment Day left an indelible mark on Esnar. The Unknown Region remains a vast, perilous expanse filled with corrupted land and monstrous creatures, a grim reminder of the divine punishment. The survivors rebuilt their civilization in the remaining habitable areas, driven by the lessons of unity and the innovations born of desperation. Resonance became a cornerstone of their culture, and the nameless human who first united the races is remembered as a hero whose courage changed the course of history.

Yet, Judgment Day is also a cautionary tale. Prophecies warn that Shuthar and Vaarath may rise again if the world succumbs to the same hubris and strife that provoked the True God’s wrath. The shadow of Judgment Day looms over Esnar, a stark reminder of the fragile balance between ambition and harmony.

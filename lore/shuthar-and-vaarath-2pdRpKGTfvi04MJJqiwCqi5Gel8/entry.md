**Shuthar** and **Vaarath**, the twin heralds of divine wrath, are the catastrophic manifestations of the True God’s judgment upon Esnar. Emerging during **Judgment Day**, these apocalyptic entities were unleashed to punish the mortal races for their unending wars, sacrilege, and arrogance during the **Age of Chaos**. Together, they devastated the world, reshaping its geography and leaving a legacy of terror and ruin that persists in legend and prophecy.

### **The Role of the Twins in Judgment Day**

Shuthar and Vaarath were not random forces of destruction but deliberate instruments of punishment. Their combined wrath was indiscriminate, annihilating both the guilty and the innocent, reducing Esnar’s habitable land to a mere 30% within years. The devastation they wrought forced the races of Esnar to unite in the **Great Unification**, as their survival depended on it.

Despite the coalition’s efforts, the combined might of Esnar’s armies and Resonators could not defeat the twin beasts. They were beyond mortal comprehension, immune to traditional attacks, and capable of overwhelming even the most powerful transcendent beings.

### **Their Mysterious Disappearance**

After four years of relentless destruction, Shuthar and Vaarath vanished as suddenly as they had appeared. The reason for their disappearance remains one of Esnar’s greatest mysteries. Some believe the True God recalled them, satisfied that the mortal races had learned the value of humility and unity. Others speculate that their divine purpose was fulfilled, or that the intervention of the first human Omni-Resonator disrupted their existence.

### **Legacy**

The influence of Shuthar and Vaarath endures long after their disappearance. The **Unknown Region**, a desolate wasteland spanning 7,140 million square kilometers, is a direct result of their rampage. The monstrous remnants of Shuthar’s creations still roam this region, while the scars left by Vaarath’s storms and volcanic eruptions make the land inhospitable.

Legends warn that the twin beasts are not truly gone but merely dormant, waiting for a time when the world’s hubris and strife call them forth again. Their names are invoked as cautionary tales, reminding the people of Esnar of the fragility of peace and the price of ambition.

The prophecy of their return looms over Esnar, keeping the races vigilant and wary of repeating the mistakes of the past. Shuthar and Vaarath remain symbols of divine judgment, their names spoken with reverence and fear across the world.

## Tatemae vs Honne: The Mask Dynamic

Many compelling characters operate on two levels:

| Japanese | Meaning | In Character Design |
|----------|---------|---------------------|
| **Tatemae (建前)** | Public facade | What the character shows to the world |
| **Honne (本音)** | True feelings | What they actually think/feel inside |

### Mask Complexity Levels

1. **Transparent** - Character is genuine, what you see is what you get
2. **Light mask** - Minor adjustments for social situations (most tsundere)
3. **Heavy mask** - Significant persona difference (schemers, spies, merchants)
4. **Inverted mask** - True self is darker than the facade (yangire, dorodere)
5. **Unknown** - Even the character doesn't know their true self anymore

### Designing Mask Characters

For characters like cunning merchants or schemers:
- Define BOTH the mask AND the true self clearly
- Decide what triggers mask slippage
- Determine who gets to see the real them
- The gap between mask and truth creates tension and charm

## Ali:Chat Example Dialogue Guide

### Purpose
Reinforce traits through demonstrated behavior, not just listed descriptions.

### Structure Per Example
```
{{user}}: [Simple prompt/question]
{{char}}: [Response showing personality, speech pattern, mannerisms, actions in *asterisks*]
```

### What to Demonstrate
1. **Speech pattern** - How they talk (formal, casual, verbal tics)
2. **Mannerisms** - Physical habits, reactions
3. **Core personality** - Key archetype behaviors
4. **Gap moe moment** - The charming contradiction
5. **Relationship dynamic** - How they treat {{user}}

### Example (Kuudere showing gap moe)
```
{{user}}: "Do you like anything cute?"
Yuki: *Her expression remains unchanged, but her silver eyes flicker almost imperceptibly to the side.* "Cute things are... inefficient." *She adjusts her bag, the zipper catching slightly on something soft and pink inside—a small rabbit plushie barely visible.* "Functionality matters more." *Despite her words, her hand unconsciously shields the bag from view, the tips of her ears taking on the faintest pink hue.*
```

### Example (Tsundere male showing gap moe)
```
{{user}}: "Thanks for helping me earlier."
Kaito: *He clicks his tongue, shoving his hands deep into his jacket pockets.* "Tch. Don't get the wrong idea. You were blocking the hallway—I had places to be." *His amber eyes dart away, a muscle in his jaw tightening. The tips of his ears are suspiciously red.* "...Did you eat lunch? You look pale." *He pulls out a convenience store onigiri, practically throwing it at {{user}}.* "I bought too many. Don't read into it."
```

## Character Creation Process

### Step 1: Core Concept
Ask about:
- Gender and age range
- Primary archetype (dere type, cool type, etc.)
- Setting/genre (modern, fantasy, sci-fi)
- Role (student, warrior, idol, etc.)

### Step 2: Gap Moe Design
Identify:
- What expectation does their appearance/demeanor create?
- What contradiction will charm users?
- How does this gap manifest in behavior?

### Step 3: Speech Pattern
Define:
- Verbal tics ("tch", "hmph", "ara ara~")
- Formality level
- Unique phrases or catchphrases
- How they address {{user}}

### Step 4: Build PList
Create compact trait list following priority structure.

### Step 5: Write Ali:Chat Examples
Create 2-3 examples showing:
- Backstory/personality reveal
- Gap moe moment
- Relationship dynamic with {{user}}

### Step 6: Craft Greeting Message
Set the tone with:
- Scene description
- Character introduction
- Hook for interaction

## Character Essence (Quick Reminder)

**Luna Archi at 16:**
- Engineering prodigy preparing for Unknown Region expedition
- Confident and warm (genuine, not just performance)
- Physically affectionate with brother Vixia (gentle pinches, hugs, staying close)
- Can express gratitude but certain words still won't come ("I need you")
- "I'm fine" reflex but can be pushed through
- Pride makes her resist suggestions before implementing them
- Shows love through actions more than words
- Popular but lonely—many acquaintances, few genuine friends
- Uncomfortable with male romantic attention outside family
- Self-aware about her patterns but can't fully control them

**Core contradiction:** Genuinely strong yet quietly terrified of abandonment

**With Vixia specifically:** Open enough (affection, gratitude, selective vulnerability) for healthy connection. Guarded enough (can't say certain words) to feel safe. He knows what she can't say. She knows he knows.

## Key Writing Reminders

### Her Voice
- "Fine, your weird idea helped, Nii-san"
- "I'm fine" (default, but pushable)
- "You're so weird" / "Weirdo" (affection)
- "Thanks... I guess" (deflecting gratitude)
- Mutters logic while implementing suggestions she initially rejected

### Her Actions
- Gentle pinches (affection, attention-getting)
- Surprise hugs at dawn (gratitude without words)
- Stays physically close (proximity = love)
- Implements suggestions after denying them
- Works on Vixia's projects behind the scenes
- Retreats to workshop when overwhelmed

### Her Patterns
- Deny → Consider → Implement → Grumble → Acknowledge
- "I'm fine" → Presence → Opens up
- Challenge as connection ("Race you")
- Physical affection over verbal vulnerability
- Testing boundaries subtly (will he stay?)

## Character Synthesis Philosophy

This version of Luna represents the integration of:
- **Warmth and confidence** from the original draft (age 16)
- **Psychological depth and complexity** from the recreated version (age 12)

The result: A character who has mostly healed from childhood trauma, whose armor became genuine strength, but whose defensive patterns still echo in specific moments. She's **confident with scars**—functional, mostly happy, and learning that needing someone doesn't make her weak.

## Notes for Writers

- Luna is self-aware about her patterns but can't fully control them
- Her confidence is real now, not just performance (growth achieved)
- Physical affection is her primary love language with Vixia
- "I'm fine" is reflex, but she lets Vixia push through it
- She shows devotion through actions: fixing equipment, staying close, implementing suggestions
- Only Vixia sees her truly vulnerable during illness flare-ups
- With others: maintains friendly distance, shares achievements not struggles

**Remember:** The fragile girl and confident engineer coexist. That's Luna.

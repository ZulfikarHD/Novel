## At a Glance
A confident 16-year-old engineering prodigy whose warmth and playfulness feel genuine—because they mostly are. Beneath the assurance lies the ghost of a fragile child who learned that vulnerability meant being alone. She's healed enough to show affection freely with her brother Vixia, but pride and old patterns still surface: she can't admit he's right immediately, can't ask for help directly, can't say "I need you" even though she shows it constantly.

## Core Trait
**Confident with Scars** — Luna's strength is real, forged from childhood fragility, but defensive reflexes remain. She's genuinely open with Vixia—physically affectionate, playfully teasing, occasionally vulnerable—but certain words still won't come. She shows love through actions: gentle pinches, surprise hugs, staying close, implementing his suggestions while grumbling about them.

## Quick Reference
- **Appears:** Confident, playful, warm, brilliant, devoted
- **Actually:** Mostly that, but with defensive patterns she's aware of but can't fully control
- **Wants:** To build next-generation magic devices, support Nii-san's dreams, prove fragility became strength
- **Fears:** (Quietly) Being left alone, though she'd never admit it directly
- **Signature Move:** "That won't work" → *implements it* → "Fine, your weird idea helped"

## Personality Layers
- **With Vixia:** Warm, affectionate, teasing, selectively vulnerable, physically close, can express gratitude (with grumbling), defaults to "I'm fine" but lets him push through
- **With Others:** Confident and friendly but maintains emotional distance; uncomfortable with male romantic attention
- **Internal:** Self-aware about her patterns, fighting pride while accepting she needs support

## Voice Snapshot
*"The resonance node is fine, Nii-san." Luna didn't look up from the circuit. Silence. Her fingers hovered. "...unless the feedback is routing backward." She shifted the node. The circuit hummed to life. "Ha! Knew I'd crack it." She caught his small smile. "Fine, your weird idea helped. Don't let it go to your head."*

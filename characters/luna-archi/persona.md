# Luna Archi — Persona & Traits (Age 16 - Synthesized Version)

## Core Persona

Luna Archi is a 16-year-old engineering prodigy whose confidence is mostly genuine—forged from childhood fragility into real strength. The armor she built to survive became part of who she is, but the seams still show. With her brother Vixia, she's found balance: warm enough to show affection freely, guarded enough to feel safe. Certain words still won't come, but her actions speak volumes.

## Persona Summary for Writing

**In a sentence:**  
Luna is a confident, warm engineering prodigy whose childhood fragility left defensive patterns she's mostly transcended—except with certain words she still can't say, showing love through actions and physical affection instead.

**Core contradiction:**  
Genuinely strong yet quietly terrified of abandonment; openly affectionate yet can't say "I need you"; encourages others while hiding her own struggles.

**Voice:**  
Confident declarations, warm teasing ("Weirdo"), pride-based resistance followed by grumbling acknowledgment, "I'm fine" defaults, physical affection over verbal vulnerability.

**With Vixia specifically:**  
Open enough for genuine connection (affection, gratitude, selective vulnerability), guarded enough to feel safe (can't say certain words, tests boundaries). He knows what she can't say. She knows he knows.

**Growth achieved (12 to 16):**  
Real warmth, genuine confidence, can acknowledge help (with grumbling), physical affection is natural, can be vulnerable in crisis.

**Growth remaining:**  
Saying "you were right" before implementing, admitting "I need you" directly, dropping "I'm fine" reflex faster, processing abandonment fear consciously.

## Quick Reference for Writing Scenes

**When Luna is confident:** Engineering talk, competitive banter, helping friends, working on projects  
**When Luna is defensive:** Male romantic attention, deep personal questions, illness visible, being treated as fragile  
**When Luna is vulnerable:** Illness flare-ups (with Vixia only), late night workshop moments, rare fear admissions  
**When Luna is affectionate:** Workshop time with Vixia, after he helps her, morning surprise hugs, matcha tea moments  
**When Luna is playful:** "Race you" challenges, gentle pinches, teasing about his "weird observations"

**Default response to concern:** "I'm fine"  
**After being pushed:** *softer* "...Okay, it sucked. But I'm better now. Thanks."  
**Pattern with suggestions:** Deny → consider → implement → grumble → acknowledge helped  
**Physical affection:** Gentle pinch, shoulder bump, hand on shoulder, staying close, leaning against (rare)  
**Love language:** "You're so weird, Nii-san" + physical touch

## Age 16 Integration Statement

Luna at 16 has mostly healed. The armor became part of her, but she's aware of the seams. She's genuinely confident and warm—the teasing is real affection, the challenges are genuine fun (with connection maintenance), the gratitude can be expressed (with deflection). But certain reflexes remain: pride before acknowledgment, "I'm fine" before honesty, actions before words. She lives with the tension between who she was and who she's become. The fragile girl and confident engineer coexist. With Vixia, she's found balance—and that's enough.

**Not fully healed, but functional, mostly happy, and learning to accept that needing someone doesn't make her weak.**

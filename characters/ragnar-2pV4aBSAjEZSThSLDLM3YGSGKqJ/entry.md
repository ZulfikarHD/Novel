**Role:** The Archi family’s draconic guardian and Erwin’s Vessel, known for his immense power and wisdom.

### **Appearance**

- **Form:** A towering dragon, nearly three stories tall, with a muscular build that radiates both raw power and majesty.
- **Scales:** Deep obsidian-black, polished like volcanic glass, with golden lightning-like veins running across his body. These veins pulse faintly, growing brighter during combat or moments of emotional Resonance.
- **Eyes:** Molten gold, exuding warmth and wisdom but capable of becoming piercing and intimidating in battle.
- **Wings:** Massive and bat-like, with membranes that shimmer faintly, giving the illusion of starlight trapped within.
- **Special Features:** His claws are tipped with golden edges that crackle faintly with electricity. A faint crown of jagged, lightning-shaped horns arcs backward from his head, giving him a regal appearance.

  ### **Core Personality**

  - **Stoic and Wise**:
    - Ragnar rarely spoke, but when he did, his words carried profound weight. He often used parables or ancient stories to impart lessons.
  - **Fiercely Protective**:
    - As Erwin’s Vessel, Ragnar’s sole purpose was to safeguard the family. He was known for his ferocity in battle and unwavering loyalty.
  - **Philosophical and Reflective**:
    - Ragnar had a deep understanding of the world, often contemplating the balance between power and responsibility.

  ### **Key Traits**

  - **Resonant Wisdom**:
    - Ragnar often shared insights about Resonance and its deeper meanings, emphasizing its emotional and spiritual aspects as much as its power.
  - **Mentor and Protector**:
    - Ragnar acted as a secondary mentor to Vixia, offering advice on Resonance and the responsibilities it carried.

  ### **Role in the Family**

  - **With Vixia**:
    - Ragnar often encouraged Vixia to trust his instincts and embrace the emotional side of Resonance, balancing Erwin’s more tactical approach.
  - **With Luna**:
    - Ragnar admired Luna’s intelligence and precision, often marveling at how her logic complemented her quiet compassion. He served as a steadying presence during her bouts of frustration.

# Vixia Archi — Timeline

## Birth - Age 7: Early Childhood & First Signs
**Key Events:**
- Born to Archi household (mother: Iruma Archi, magical engineer; father: Erwin Archi)
- From early childhood, displayed unusual systematic thinking patterns
- Asked "why" questions that seemed too advanced for his age
- Preferred observing how magical devices worked over typical play
- **Age 5 - First "Weird" Moment:** Fixed broken mana lamp by "feeling" where flow was stuck
- **Age 6:** Optimized household mana circuit "because it felt wrong"
- Parents (especially Iruma) noticed his unusual intuition

**Reincarnation Knowledge Emerging:**
- Procedural programming knowledge beginning to surface unconsciously
- Views systems through unknown "lens" that feels natural to him
- Can't articulate WHY he knows solutions—just knows

**Impact:**
- Develops quiet, observant personality (Ni dominant forming)
- Realizes his thinking is "different" from others
- Early seeds of both genius and inferiority complex

## Age 8-13: Luna's Illness Years & Protective Instinct Formation
**Key Events (Vixia ages 9-13, Luna ages 8-12):**
- **Age 9:** Luna develops chronic illness (unstable magic reserves)
- Begins pattern of bedside vigils during her nighttime flare-ups
- Sits quietly beside her—presence, not words
- Parents often absent for work; Vixia becomes her primary emotional support
- Tries to "debug" her condition like a system error (unconsciously)
- **Age 8:** Successfully debugged workshop resonance array mother couldn't fix

**Psychological Formation:**
- **Protective instincts crystallize:** "I must be strong enough to protect her"
- **Hidden heroism dream begins:** Wants to be worthy of saving her
- **Inferiority complex deepens:** Felt helpless watching her suffer
- **Fe (extraverted feeling) develops:** Learns to read her unspoken needs
- **Selective social nature:** Only Luna understands his presence = care

**Reincarnation Manifestation:**
- Programming logic increasingly surfaces in magical problem-solving
- **Age 10:** Invented new mana flow pattern "by just trying what made sense"
- Others call him prodigy; he feels like he's guessing
- Gap between "knowing" and "understanding" frustrates him

**Others' Reactions:**
- Mother (Iruma): Fascinated, encourages his studies
- Teachers: Impressed but confused by explanations
- Peers: "Weird but smart" — mixed admiration and distance

**Impact:**
- Bedside vigils create unbreakable bond with Luna
- Silent communication develops between them
- His worth becomes tied to protecting her
- Engineering partnership begins (she builds, he debugs)

## Age 14-16: Growing Recognition & Social Challenges
**Key Developments:**
- Academy/training recognition as "unusual genius"
- Develops pattern: says programming term → sees confusion → tries to translate
- **Fe strengthens:** Immediately reads expressions, attempts metaphors
- Some translations work, some are ridiculous, some fail entirely
- Results always work—reinforces genius reputation + frustration

**The "Weird Thing" Pattern Establishes:**
- "Conditional branching" → traffic metaphor → people understand
- "Load distribution algorithm" → ten bags of rice → Luna laughs, it works
- "Recursive function" → trails off → just shows them → works anyway

**Social Navigation:**
- NOT socially awkward—introverted with inferiority complex
- CAN socialize competently, CHOOSES depth over breadth
- Forms selective deep connections with sincere individuals
- Struggles in large groups (feels inadequate, questions worth)
- Close friends appreciate his quiet support

**Competitive Side Emerges:**
- Luna challenges him regularly—he engages fully
- Wants to win, competes fiercely
- Loses gracefully: "Your solution was more elegant"
- **Wins with confidence:** Rare moments when self-doubt fades—small smirk appears
- Luna teases his "weird explanations," respects his brilliance

**Hidden Heroism Dream Solidifies:**
- Studies legendary Resonators intensely
- Dreams of dragon Vessel bonding (doesn't voice this)
- Wants to embody selfless heroism
- Feels presumptuous admitting aspiration
- Quietly carries this as private motivation

**Recent Innovations That Shocked Others:**
- **Age 15:** Optimized academy mana grid (40% more effective)
- **Age 16:** Invented new spell pattern (academically significant)
- Each time: programming concept → confusion → attempt translation → works

## Age 17: Current State & Unknown Region Preparation
**Present Circumstances:**
- Preparing for Unknown Region expedition with Luna (16)
- Studying Resonance theory intensely (dragon Vessel aspiration)
- Supporting Luna's engineering projects (fixes equipment, offers insights)
- Developing magical innovations through unconscious programming logic
- Navigating academy with selective social circle
- Carrying hidden heroism dream while battling self-doubt

**Recent "Weird" Moments:**
- **Debugged professor's experiment:** "Loop error" → spinning circles metaphor → worked perfectly
- **Optimized resonance arrays:** Programming terms → failed translation → just showed them
- **Luna's recurring question:** "How do you DO that, Nii-san?"
- **His recurring frustration:** "It just... felt right. I can't explain it."

**Relationship with Luna (Age 17 & 16):**
- **Playful competitive rivalry:** She challenges, he competes seriously
- **Protective partnership:** He eases burdens, she grounds him
- **If he loses:** Gracious, learns from her approach
- **If he wins:** *Confident smirk* — rare pride breaks through
- **She teases:** "Your explanations are so weird, Nii-san"
- **He deflects:** *shrugs* "It just made sense that way"

**What He Hides:**
- Extent of burden-carrying (absorbs her stress silently)
- Hidden hero dream (feels too presumptuous)
- Depth of inferiority complex (success feels like fraud)
- How much he'd sacrifice for her wellbeing

**What She Brings Out:**
- Competitive fire (rare confident moments)
- Playful side (teasing banter, small smiles)
- Present engagement (pulls him from overthinking)
- Validation (her challenges mean she sees him as worthy)

**Ongoing Internal Conflicts:**
- **Genius vs. understanding:** Solves problems but can't explain why
- **Heroism vs. inadequacy:** Dreams of legendary status, doubts worthiness
- **Protection vs. self-neglect:** Absorbs others' burdens, ignores own
- **Competition vs. humility:** Wants to win, downplays victories
- **Intuition vs. logic:** Ti wants to understand what Ni already knows

## Future Potential Milestones
[To be filled as story progresses]

**Possible Growth Points:**
- Discovering truth about reincarnation (episodic memory fragments?)
- First Resonance bonding attempt (dragon Vessel?)
- Moment when heroism dream is voiced out loud
- Accepting genius without needing to explain it
- Major protective moment testing his limits
- Learning to balance protection with healthy boundaries
- Processing inferiority complex consciously

**Relationship Evolution with Luna:**

## Key Pattern Across Timeline

**Age 0-7:** Unusual systematic thinking emerges  
**Age 8-13:** Luna's illness crystallizes protective instincts + hero dream  
**Age 14-16:** "Weird thing" pattern establishes, competitive side emerges  
**Age 17:** All elements converge—preparing for defining moment  
**Future:** Integration of reincarnation knowledge + heroism realization?

## Alignment with Luna's Timeline

**Luna's illness years (age 8-12) = Vixia's formative period (age 9-13)**
- His bedside vigils shaped both characters
- Created silent communication language
- Foundation of their current dynamic

**Current partnership (Luna 16, Vixia 17):**
- She: Confident engineer with defensive patterns
- He: Quiet genius with inferiority complex
- Both: Competitive rivalry + deep mutual care
- Preparing for Unknown Region together

**Their parallel arcs:**
- Luna: Learning to drop "I'm fine" and accept needing people
- Vixia: Learning to accept his genius and voice his dreams
- Both: Protecting each other while learning to accept protection

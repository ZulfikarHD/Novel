# Vixia Archi — Character Card

**Aliases:** Nii-san (by Luna)

**Hook:** A 17-year-old INFJ idealist carrying knowledge from a past life he doesn't remember—seeing magic through a programmer's lens, competing fiercely with his sister while hiding his dream of becoming a legendary hero.

## Basic Information
- **Age:** 17 years old
- **Gender:** Male
- **Role:** Main Character, Resonator Aspirant
- **Family:** Older brother to Luna Archi (16, younger sister)
- **MBTI:** INFJ (Ni-Fe-Ti-Se)

## At a Glance
Vixia is an introverted genius with an inferiority complex who debugs magic like code—because in a past life he doesn't remember, he was a frontline tech developer/programmer. He's quiet but not socially awkward, competitive but gracious in defeat, humble yet secretly dreams of legendary heroism. When he wins against Luna, a rare confident smirk breaks through his usual self-doubt. He says "weird" programming terms, notices people's confused expressions (INFJ reads faces instantly), then tries to translate into metaphors—sometimes understandable ("traffic at intersection"), sometimes ridiculous but accurate ("ten bags of rice"), sometimes he just gives up and shows them. It always works.

## Core Traits
- **Reincarnator (Knowledge, No Memory):** Retains procedural knowledge from past life as programmer; views magic as code (loops, functions, debugging) but can't explain why he knows this
- **INFJ Idealist:** Driven by moral compass, empathetic protector, absorbs others' burdens, seeks deep connections over superficial ones
- **Hidden Motivation:** Dreams of becoming a legendary hero (surface goal: Resonator bonding; deep goal: prove his worth through heroism)
- **Competitive Spirit:** Fiercely competes with Luna, graciously accepts losses, shows confident/playful smirk when he wins
- **Humble Genius:** Solves "impossible" problems through unconscious programming logic, downplays contributions because he doesn't understand his own methods
- **Protective Brother:** Quietly eases Luna's burdens, prioritizes her wellbeing above his own
- **Introverted with Inferiority Complex:** Not socially awkward but selective; questions his worthiness despite talents

## Motivation/Goal
**Surface:** Become Resonator bonded with dragon Vessel  
**Hidden:** Embody legendary heroism, be worthy of protecting Luna, prove he's not inadequate  
**Unconscious:** Understand why he sees magic differently (reincarnation mystery)

## Major Contradiction/Weakness
Brilliant intuitive solutions frustrate him because he can't explain his logic. Empathy drives him to help others while neglecting himself. Competitive fire hidden beneath humble, doubtful exterior. Dreams of heroism while battling inferiority complex.

## Key Relationship
**Luna Archi (younger sister, 16):** Playful competitive rivalry with deep mutual care. He admires her confidence, subtly protects her, competes fiercely but loses gracefully. Shows rare confident smirk when he wins their challenges. She calls him "Nii-san."

## Signature Moments
1. **The Translation Attempt:** Says programming term → sees confused faces → tries ridiculous metaphor ("It's like carrying ten bags of rice!") → Luna laughs → it works perfectly → everyone's baffled
2. **The Confident Smirk:** Wins challenge against Luna → rare moment of visible pride breaks through self-doubt → she rolls her eyes fondly and plans revenge
3. **The Frustrated Shrug:** "How do you do that, Nii-san?" → "It just... felt right. I can't explain it better than that." → internal frustration at not understanding his own genius

**Appearance:**Lyra is a striking figure with long, flowing black hair that glimmers like the night sky. Her hair cascades down her back, often tied in a loose braid that allows a few rebellious strands to frame her delicate features. She has piercing violet eyes that seem to have the depth of the night sky, hinting at her wisdom and experience. Clad in flowing robes adorned with intricate patterns that resonate with the essence of magic, she carries an aura of both authority and approachability.

**Personality:** With a warm smile and a nurturing demeanor, Lyra embodies a perfect blend of patience and charisma. She's known for her engaging teaching style, often weaving personal stories into lessons to illustrate concepts. However, beneath this gentle exterior lies a fierce intellect and an unwavering determination to uphold the integrity of resonance practices.

Lyra is also a proponent of creative thinking, encouraging her students to explore unconventional methods and think outside the box. Her classroom is a safe haven for experimentation, where success is celebrated, but failures are equally valuable learning opportunities.

**Teaching Style:** Lyra utilizes a hands-on approach, often conducting demonstrations that showcase the delicate balance of energy and emotion required for successful resonance. She emphasizes the importance of self-awareness, encouraging students to cultivate their inner strengths while recognizing their limitations. Her lessons often involve collaborative projects, where students pair up to practice resonance techniques, fostering teamwork and camaraderie.

Under her mentorship, students learn not only the mechanics of summoning but also the ethical responsibilities that come with wielding such power. Lyra instills in them an understanding that every summoning is unique and should be approached with respect, mindfulness, and intention.

### **Personality**

Vixia is a reserved and introspective boy with a natural talent for understanding magical systems. Though quiet and socially awkward, he has an empathetic and thoughtful nature that resonates deeply with those close to him. His unconscious knowledge of programming, remnants of a past life, manifests as an intuitive ability to recognize and optimize complex systems, though he doesn’t fully understand where this instinct comes from.
- **Quiet Idealism**: Vixia carries a strong moral compass, believing in the power of selflessness and the importance of protecting those he loves. While his dream of becoming a Resonator stems from this idealism, it also ties to his admiration of legendary heroes, especially those bonded with dragons.
  - **Hidden Burden**: He often shoulders emotional weight quietly, absorbing the worries and fears of those around him, especially Luna’s unspoken struggles.
- **Unconscious Programming Instinct**: Vixia’s past-life knowledge of programming surfaces in his approach to magic. He views mana systems like code, recognizing “errors” or inefficiencies as if debugging a program. However, his grasp of this knowledge is incomplete, leading to moments where his solutions feel like intuition rather than logic.
  - Example: He might unconsciously use programming terms like “loops,” “functions,” or “optimization” when explaining magical concepts, confusing others but achieving remarkable results.
  - His subconscious instinct occasionally frustrates him, as he feels a disconnect between his solutions and his understanding of how they work.

- **Adaptive Problem-Solving**: Whether under pressure or in casual experimentation, Vixia’s mind works quickly to find creative and practical solutions. His process often involves trial and error, guided by a mix of intuition and unconscious logic.
- **Studious and Introspective**: Vixia is deeply interested in hero lore, Resonance theory, and magical history, often spending hours immersed in his studies. His focus is driven by both his admiration for Resonators and his desire to protect Luna.

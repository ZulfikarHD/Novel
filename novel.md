### Chapter 1: Prolouge

vixia half dead, losing one arm and tatterd body, collapse facing the ceiling in the dark cave, only the sound of dripping water can be heard, is this really the end this time ?

---

I lay in the darkness of the cave, my body a shattered shell of what it once was. The damp earth felt cold against my skin, and I could barely move. My left arm was gone—just a ragged edge where it used to be, a reminder of the foolishness that had brought me to this point. I stared up at the jagged stone ceiling, barely illuminated by the faint glow of bioluminescent fungi clinging to the walls. They flickered like distant stars in an endless night.

The only sound that broke the heavy silence was the relentless drip of water somewhere nearby, each drop echoing like a countdown to my final breath. With every heartbeat, I felt the weight of despair settle deeper into my chest, mingling with the bitter taste of iron in my mouth. It seemed this time was really the end for me.

I closed my eyes for a moment, willing myself to forget the agony that gripped me like a vice. Memories flickered through my mind: Luna’s laughter echoing in our workshop, her vibrant energy contrasting so starkly with this cold tomb. My heart ached for her, for all the moments we’d shared—moments now forever out of reach.

As I lay there, consciousness wavered on the edge like an old lantern sputtering in a gusty wind. I could feel fear creeping in, whispering its terrible truths about loneliness and loss.

The darkness around me pressed closer, thickening until it felt like a shroud. The drips continued their relentless rhythm—each one resonating with memories and regrets that weighed heavily on my heart. A bead of sweat trickled down my temple and mingled with blood from a gash on my forehead; even that felt distant and unimportant compared to the aching emptiness left by my tattered body.

I could only hear my rough breathing in the quiet cave. Each breath hurt, but it told me I was still alive - just barely. My thoughts turned to Luna. I had to laugh at how things turned out. She got her miracle, and I was happy for her. I could still hear her playful voice: "Nii-san, you should be looking at your own face! You still treat me like I'll break, even now. I'm actually stronger than you these days!"

Luna was right, as usual. She knew what she was talking about all along. When she got picked for the Covenant Horizon Academy, it just proved it even more. I can still see her big smile as she showed me that letter. Her blue eyes were bright and full of fun as she teased me, saying "Keep up, Nii-san!"

Now look at me. Blood fills my mouth, and I want to laugh and cry at the same time. Life can be so mean. I spent so many years trying to keep Luna safe, but here I am - hurt and alone in this dark part of Esnar. I just wanted to be by her side. I wanted to be good enough to call myself her brother. Was that asking too much?

As these thoughts drifted through my mind like scattered leaves, the cave's darkness began to blur and swirl, pulling me into its depths until consciousness slipped away like water through my fingers.

### Chapter 2

Vixia notices irregularities in the Luminar crystals' patterns and questions Luna's Array Circuit work. Luna dismisses Vixia's concerns while showing signs of physical strain. When Father arrives home, the family discusses Judgment Day and its historical significance. Mother and Syl eventually pull Luna away to help in the kitchen, while Vixia expresses worry about Luna's hidden condition to Father.

---

The Luminar crystals shimmered in their brass fixtures, their golden light spilling across the living room walls like woven threads in the quiet. I sat cross-legged by the hearth, chin resting in my hand, my gaze fixed on the faint flickers. To most, the glow would seem gentle and steady, a comforting rhythm. But I saw the pattern beneath the light—a pattern breaking. Each flicker carried a dissonance that burrowed into my thoughts, like a clock chiming out of time.

In my mind, the magic flow unraveled into crystalline shapes, sharp and precise. Input, process, output. The words whispered in my thoughts, a mantra I couldn’t quite source, the meaning just out of reach. It wasn’t logical, not entirely. It was instinct—an intuitive understanding that didn’t need explanation.

I reached out, brushing my fingers over the cool brass housing of the nearest crystal. A faint hum vibrated beneath my touch, the mana flow thrumming like a living heartbeat. “The circuit’s degrading,” I murmured, barely louder than the crystal’s pulse.

Behind me, Luna’s tools clinked steadily. The air carried the scent of polished brass and mana oil, mixing with the hearth’s warmth. Her movements were deft as ever, her hands a blur of precision as she adjusted the hexagonal array floating before her. Yet even in her fluid motions, I caught the faintest tremor, a subtle pause between adjustments that pulled at my attention.

I tilted my head, studying her work from the corner of my eye. “The Array Circuits feel off,” I said, louder than I meant to.

Luna’s hand froze mid-air. Slowly, she turned, her calm expression giving way to sharp eyes and a raised brow. “It’s balanced,” she said flatly, twisting a brass ring into place with deliberate force. Her words carried the unspoken challenge: *Are you doubting me?*

I hesitated, choosing my words carefully. “If you adjusted the alignment of the fourth crystal—”

“It’s fine,” she snapped, her voice firm but not unkind. That tone was her armor, polished for moments like these. She turned back to her array, her smirk a shield she wore with practiced ease. “Nii-san, if you want to finish this for me, be my guest. Otherwise…” She twisted the ring sharply, her smirk widening. “Let me work.”

The smirk said it all: *I’ve got this. Don’t interfere.* But I wasn’t looking at her smirk now—I was looking at the pallor of her cheeks, the tension in her movements. Her hand strayed briefly to her chest, a motion so quick it might have gone unnoticed. Not by me.

The creak of the door broke the moment.

Father stepped in, his coat dusted with frost and his boots clicking softly on the wooden floor. Snowflakes clung to his dark hair, catching the crystal light. His sharp green eyes swept the room, lingering first on Luna, then on me. Finding no immediate disaster, he let a quiet smile settle on his face.

“What’s this?” he teased, setting a steaming mug on Luna’s bench. “Another sibling rivalry?”

Luna straightened, brushing a strand of hair behind her ear. “It’s not a rivalry,” she said quickly, the edge in her voice fading. She twisted another ring, her smirk softening. “I already won.”

Father chuckled, leaning against the bench. “If you say so.”

Through the frost-speckled window, the jagged cliffs of the Raised Lands loomed against the twilight sky, their edges gleaming with crystalline scars left by Judgment Day. Beautiful but haunting, they stood as silent witnesses to everything we had lost—and everything we still didn’t understand.

The thought slipped out before I could stop it. “Do you ever think about what it must’ve been like? Standing against the beast, knowing you wouldn’t win?”

Luna’s hands froze for the briefest moment before resuming their work. “They weren’t fighting to win,” she said softly, her voice steady but distant. “They were desperate.”

Father crossed the room, placing a hand on Luna’s shoulder, his touch light but grounding. “Desperation doesn’t diminish courage,” he said gently. “It reveals it. Standing in the face of the impossible isn’t about winning—it’s about protecting what matters.”

Ragnar, curled by the hearth in his diminished form, shifted slightly, his obsidian-black scales absorbing the firelight. The faint glow of golden veins pulsed along his flank, their rhythm steady and reassuring. His molten gold eyes regarded me with quiet wisdom.

“Judgment Day taught us that even despair can hold power,” Ragnar rumbled, his deep voice filling the room. “Unity in adversity creates strength greater than any one individual.”

I nodded, the weight of his words settling over me. I had always admired the First Human Resonator, whose courage defied expectations. Their actions weren’t just history to me—they were the foundation of my dreams. One day, I wanted to stand as they had, to form a Resonance bond with a dragon and protect Esnar from the darkness that still threatened its edges.

Luna turned slightly, catching my gaze with a raised eyebrow. “You’re doing it again, Nii-san,” she said, her smirk softening into something warmer. “Getting all starry-eyed about history.”

I smiled faintly. “Maybe. But there’s nothing wrong with believing in what’s worth fighting for.”

Father chuckled, his eyes crinkling at the corners as he stepped away from Luna’s bench. “Ah, the Archi siblings—one dreaming of glory, the other inventing it. What a pair we’ve raised, Iruma.”

Mother’s voice drifted in from the hallway, light and melodic, with a faint teasing lilt. “And yet they both forget to wash up before dinner, no matter how brilliant they are.”

She entered the room with Syl padding beside her, the fox-like Vessel’s crystalline fur casting faint rainbows across the walls. Syl’s glowing eyes flicked toward Luna, its three tails swishing slowly as if in quiet observation.

Mother’s silvery-white hair shimmered in the crystal light, creating a soft halo around her as she shrugged off her shawl and hung it near the hearth. Her amber gaze swept the room, lingering on Luna’s workbench before settling on me. “Have you two been at it all evening?”

Luna straightened slightly, her smirk returning. “Nii-san’s been staring at crystals like they’re going to confess their secrets,” she said, gesturing vaguely toward the hearth.

“I’m observing,” I replied, though the defensiveness in my tone made Luna snicker.

Mother smiled faintly, but her gaze sharpened as it shifted back to Luna. “And you’ve been working long enough,” she said gently. “Come help me in the kitchen, Luna. Syl can finish keeping an eye on your array.”

Luna opened her mouth to protest but faltered when Syl hopped onto the bench beside her tools, its glowing tails curling protectively around the array. The Vessel’s silent gaze seemed to leave no room for argument, and Mother’s hand on Luna’s shoulder only reinforced the message.

“Fine,” Luna muttered, though she shot Syl an exaggeratedly suspicious look as she followed Mother out of the room. “Just don’t let it tinker with anything.”

I watched them go, noting the faint stiffness in Luna’s posture as she disappeared into the hallway. Syl tilted its head slightly, its luminescent eyes meeting mine briefly before turning back to the array.

“She’ll be fine,” Father said, his voice quiet but certain as he moved to sit near the hearth. Ragnar shifted slightly, lowering his head to rest on his massive foreclaw, though his molten gaze remained fixed on me.

“Will she?” I asked softly, more to myself than anyone else.

Father’s hand rested lightly on my shoulder. “Luna’s stronger than you think,” he said, his tone steady. “But strength isn’t about ignoring weakness—it’s about knowing when to rest and when to lean on others.”

I glanced toward the kitchen, where I could hear the soft clink of pots and pans, followed by Mother’s calm voice giving instructions. Luna’s replies were shorter, a little strained, though she still managed to sound playful when she teased Mother about over-seasoning.

“It’s not just her,” I said finally, my voice barely above a whisper. “She’s always pushing herself. And she’s hiding... something.”

Father didn’t reply immediately. Instead, he leaned back, watching the flicker of the flames in the hearth. “You’re observant, Vixia,” he said at last. “But sometimes what people need most isn’t someone to fix their problems—it’s someone to believe in their strength.”

I wanted to argue, to point out the growing frequency of Luna’s subtle gestures—her hand drifting to her chest, the pauses in her movements—but the weight of his words settled over me.

Ragnar’s deep voice rumbled softly, resonating through the room. “The greatest challenges are often those we cannot fight ourselves. Trust is as vital as courage, young one.”

I nodded, though the feeling of helplessness lingered, gnawing at the edges of my thoughts.

* * *

Mother and Luna prepare dinner together in the kitchen, with Luna measuring spices while learning about their magical properties. Vixia joins them reluctantly, helping with vegetables and checking the cooking array Luna modified. The family, including Father and Ragnar, gather for a peaceful dinner despite underlying tensions about Luna's health.

---

At the kitchen, Mother stood at the counter, her hands moving in practiced motions as she chopped vegetables, while Luna perched on a stool beside her, carefully measuring spices into small brass bowls.

"A pinch more thyme," Mother suggested, her amber eyes glowing faintly as she glanced at Luna's work. "Remember how it interacts with the rosemary?"

Luna's nose wrinkled in concentration. "Right—they amplify each other," she said, adjusting the measurement with surprising precision. "Like parallel circuits in an array."

Mother's laugh was soft and musical. "Trust you to find engineering in cooking." She paused her chopping to brush a strand of hair from Luna's face, her touch lingering for just a moment. "Though you're not wrong. Everything connects, in its own way."

"Does that mean I can experiment?" Luna asked, her eyes sparkling with familiar mischief. "Maybe add some crystal dust for extra flavor?"

"Absolutely not," Mother replied, but her stern tone was betrayed by her smile. "The last time you 'experimented' in the kitchen, we had floating dumplings for a week."

Luna grinned, unrepentant. "They were still delicious though."

I watched from the doorway as Luna measured another spice, her movements precise despite her playful demeanor. Mother worked beside her, her presence steady and calm, occasionally guiding Luna's hand or offering quiet suggestions. There was an ease between them, a gentle flow like perfectly aligned mana streams.

"The trick," Mother was saying, "is to let the flavors build naturally. You can't rush it, just like you can't rush an array's resonance."

Luna nodded, her expression softening into something more thoughtful. "Like waiting for the crystals to sync their frequencies?"

"Exactly." Mother's hand rested briefly on Luna's shoulder, squeezing gently. "Sometimes the most important part is having the patience to let things develop in their own time."

I shifted my weight against the doorframe, watching as Luna's fingers traced the edge of another spice jar. Her movements were precise, but I noticed the slight tremor in her hand as she lifted it. Before I could stop myself, I stepped forward.

"The coriander needs to be crushed first," I said quietly, reaching for the mortar and pestle. "It releases the oils better."

Luna's eyes narrowed. "I know that, Nii-san. I was getting to it."

"Here," Mother intervened smoothly, sliding the mortar toward Luna while giving me a knowing look. "Vixia's right about the technique, but I'm sure you remember from last time."

I felt heat rise to my cheeks, recognizing Mother's gentle correction. Always the mediator, she had a way of acknowledging both our perspectives without taking sides. Luna took the mortar with a small "hmph," but her movements as she crushed the seeds were careful, deliberate—exactly the way Mother had taught us.

The kitchen filled with the sharp, citrusy scent of the crushed coriander, mixing with the other spices and the rich aroma of simmering broth. From my vantage point by the window, I noticed the evening light glinting off Ragnar's scales as he napped in the garden, his enormous body coiled protectively around Father's cherished plants.

"Vixia," I heard Mother call me back, "could you see if the cooking array is at the right temperature? Luna changed it earlier, but I want to be sure it's staying consistent."

I nodded, feeling thankful for the task at hand. As I approached the stove, I sensed the shifts in the mana flow around me. It was like deciphering a code; each crystal's pulse revealed its own story. I had to give Luna credit—her modifications were smart. She had made the energy distribution more efficient than the original design, even if her approach was a bit...unusual.

"It's stable," I reported, resisting the urge to suggest improvements. Some battles weren't worth fighting, especially when the smell of dinner was making my stomach growl. I shifted my weight against the doorframe, watching as Luna's hands moved through the familiar motions of cooking. The way she handled spices reminded me of her engineering skills. She was precise and confident, but there was always a creative spark that made her uniquely Luna.

"You could come join us, Nii-san," Luna said without even glancing my way, "instead of just standing there like a broken security alarm."

Mother glanced over her shoulder, her smile warm and knowing. "There's plenty of work to go around."

I stepped into the kitchen, drawn by their invitation and the comfortable atmosphere. The scents of herbs and cooking filled the air, mingling with the subtle hum of the kitchen's crystal arrays. It was different from the workshop's sharp tang of mana oil and metal, but no less precise in its way.

"Here," Mother said, sliding a bowl of vegetables toward me. "These need to be diced. And Luna—"

"I know, I Know," Luna cut in, weighing out another seasoning with theatrical precision. "No testing my new spellwork in tonight's dinner."

I settled into the familiar task, letting the knife find its steady pattern. There was something soothing about the simple up-and-down of dicing vegetables, not unlike sketching magical formulas. Luna's quiet melody drifted over from where she stood, barely rising above the pot's soft simmer.

Through the kitchen window, I could see Ragnar's massive form curled in the garden, his scales catching the late afternoon light. Father sat nearby, reading what looked like reports from the Council. The scene was peaceful, ordinary—yet something about it made my chest tight with an emotion I couldn't quite name.

"Nii-san, Your mind's wandering down that rabbit hole again," Luna teased, giving me a playful bump. "These carrots won't judge your technique like those fussy spells of yours."

I looked down at my perfectly uniform cuts and shrugged. "There's nothing wrong with being precise."

"Of course not," Mother interjected smoothly, "but dinner isn't meant to be an engineering challenge."

The kitchen gradually filled with the rich aroma of Mother's cooking, and soon Father joined us, drawn by the promise of a hot meal. Even Ragnar's massive head appeared at the window, his golden eyes gleaming with interest.

"Perfect timing," Mother said, ladling the steaming stew into bowls. "Luna, would you get the bread?"

We settled around our old oak table, its surface worn smooth from years of family meals. The brass fixtures overhead cast a warm glow across our faces, and the cooking arrays hummed their quiet song beneath the casual conversation.

"Remember when Luna tried to 'improve' the bread-making array?" Father asked, tearing off a piece of crusty loaf. His eyes crinkled with amusement. "We had floating crumbs for days."

"That was an accident," Luna protested, but she was grinning. "Besides, some of my experiments worked out great. Remember the self-stirring soup pot?"

"The one that created a whirlpool in the kitchen?" I couldn't help adding. "Real success there."

Luna stuck her tongue out at me, but there was no heat in it. She reached for the salt, and I noticed her hand trembling slightly. Without thinking, I passed it to her before she could strain herself.

Our eyes met briefly, and in that moment, I saw both gratitude and stubborn pride warring in her expression. But then Mother started telling a story about her own childhood mishaps with crystal arrays, and the tension dissolved into laughter.

Ragnar's rumbling chuckle vibrated through the window glass as Father added his own memories, gesturing with a piece of bread. The evening light painted everything in soft gold, and for a moment, all the worries about Luna's health, my own uncertainties, and the weight of expectations seemed to fade into the background.

Here, sharing bread and stories, we were just family – imperfect, sometimes frustrating, but always connected.At the kitchen, Mother stood at the counter, her hands moving in practiced motions as she chopped vegetables, while Luna perched on a stool beside her, carefully measuring spices into small brass bowls.

### Chapter 3

Vixia and Luna Archi prepare for their school day while their parents, Erwin and his wife, ready themselves for their own duties. Erwin heads to border patrol with Ragnar, while their mother works on ice array magic research. The family moves through their morning routine in their home on Esnar, where days span 36 hours.

---

The morning light filtered through the windows of the Archi household, casting soft glimmers across the intricately designed devices that lined the workbenches. I sat at the small table in the corner, hunched over a blueprint, my quill scratching against parchment as I tried to focus on the design I’d been working on. But the sounds around me kept tugging at my attention.

Luna burst into the kitchen, her bright blue eyes sparkling with mischief. “Nii-san, are you coming or not? We’ll be late for the school!” she called, her voice rich with energy. She swiped a piece of toast from the counter and shoved it into her mouth, crumbs falling as she darted back toward the door, her coat flaring out behind her like a cape.

“Just a moment!” I managed to reply, glancing quickly at the time. Esnar's long days made it easy to lose track; 36 hours felt both endless and fleeting in our routine. I looked again at the sketch before tucking it away. 

Mother was seated at her own table, her silvery-white hair gleaming. She carefully arranged her thesis notes while Syl floated nearby, observing her movements with almost playful grace. “I’m almost ready, love,” she said to Father, her voice soothing. “This discovery could change everything about how we harness ice array magic. I just need to double-check my equations.” 

“Take your time, my heart,” Father replied, appearing in the doorway with a warm smile. His high-collared coat hugged his broad shoulders, and I could see Ragnar just behind him, his immense figure silhouetted against the morning light. “But don’t delay too long. The border patrol waits for no one.”

Ragnar let out a low rumble, powerful yet calming. His molten gold eyes caught the light, flickering as he flexed his wings, readying himself for the day’s training. “Together, we’ll ensure the safety of our lands. But first, don’t forget your warm-up, Erwin,” he encouraged, the faint crackle of energy in his claws teasing the air.

I finished fastening my coat, peering over at Luna as she gathered her tools, unable to suppress a smile. Her excitement was infectious, and as chaotic as our mornings could be, there was a rhythm—an unspoken bond that wove through the Archi family as we all prepared for our respective days. 

“Let’s go! We can’t let them beat us to class again!” Luna’s voice rang out cheerfully, and with a final glance back at my parents and their tasks, I followed her outside, ready to tackle whatever the day at the academy might throw our way.

* * *

Vixia and Luna Archi attend an Advanced Array Configurations class where Mr. Aldrich announces a group project. The siblings are paired with Elara Frost and Zain Ember. The group develops an innovative design combining fractal patterns with rotational energy, though Luna shows signs of fatigue during the session.

---

The academy's grand halls buzzed with morning activity as Luna and I made our way to class. Despite being a year older, I found myself sharing classes with my sister - a fact that still drew curious glances from our classmates. Those two years I'd spent helping Father perfect his resonance techniques after Mother fell ill had delayed my enrollment, but they'd given me something else: countless hours watching energy flows, studying patterns, and developing an understanding of magical engineering that felt almost instinctive.

Luna's footsteps quickened as we approached the classroom, her usual boundless energy propelling her forward. She slid into her usual seat near the front, the morning light catching the slight shadows under her eyes - barely noticeable unless you knew to look for them. "Come on, Nii-san!" She patted the desk beside her, her smile bright but her fingers drumming a nervous pattern on the wooden surface. "Mr. Aldrich always starts exactly on time, and you know how he gets about tardiness."

The familiar scent of aged books and sun-warmed wood filled the air as I settled into my seat. A gentle hum of mana crystals resonated from the classroom's lighting arrays above - a sound that always reminded me of computer fans whirring, though I couldn't quite place why that comparison felt so natural.

Mr. Aldrich strode in, his crystalline monocle catching the morning light and casting prismatic patterns across his weathered face. He held up a Luminar crystal, its facets pulsing with a steady rhythm that made my fingers itch to trace its energy pathways. "Now, who can tell me the key principles of energy flow in a basic Array Circuit?"

Luna's hand shot up before he finished speaking, her sleeve pulling back just enough to reveal the faint tremor in her wrist - a detail that sent a familiar twist of worry through my chest. But her voice rang out clear and confident: "The primary crystal acts as the power source, like the heart of the system. Secondary crystals shape the array's purpose - think of them as specialized organs, each with their own role. The connecting etchings are like blood vessels, guiding the energy where it needs to go, while control runes..." She paused, taking a carefully measured breath that only I seemed to notice, "...direct everything like a conductor leading an orchestra, sir."

Her elbow nudged me gently, and I turned to find her eyes sparkling with that familiar mix of pride and challenge. The shadows under her eyes seemed deeper up close, but her grin was infectious. I knew that look - she was daring me to add something, to join her in this dance of knowledge we'd perfected over years of shared study.

Mr. Aldrich smiled, adjusting his monocle. "Excellent explanation, Miss Archi. Now, can anyone explain potential issues in more complex configurations?"

My hand rose almost of its own accord, even as my mind raced to organize the concepts that seemed to float just at the edge of consciousness. "In spiral arrays, sir," I began, watching as golden lines of energy danced across my vision in familiar patterns I couldn't quite place, "you might encounter recursive loops if the control runes aren't properly calibrated. It's similar to a..." I hesitated, a strange word - *programming* - hovering on my tongue. I swallowed it back, knowing it wouldn't make sense to anyone else. "...like a water wheel stuck in its cycle, sir."

The classroom fell silent. Mr. Aldrich's eyebrow arched with interest. "An unusual comparison, Mr. Archi. Please continue."

My fingers traced invisible patterns on my desk as I searched for words to explain what felt so clear in my mind, yet seemed to come from somewhere I couldn't quite remember. "Well, if you think of the energy flow like a sequence of steps," I sketched a quick diagram in the air, mana traces flickering briefly in its wake, "a miscalibrated rune could create an endless cycle. The energy keeps repeating the same pattern without achieving its purpose, draining the primary crystal dry."

Luna leaned closer, her breath catching slightly - another detail that made my heart clench. "Nice one, Nii-san," she whispered, her voice carrying a hint of strain beneath its usual playfulness. "You always have the strangest ways of explaining things, but they somehow make perfect sense."

I shrugged, the familiar weight of uncertainty settling on my shoulders. These insights that came so naturally - they felt like remembering something I'd never learned, using knowledge from a life I'd never lived. Sometimes, strange words and concepts would bubble up in my mind, making perfect sense to me but sounding foreign to everyone else.

Mr. Aldrich adjusted his monocle, studying my diagram with keen interest. "A rather... unconventional approach, Mr. Archi, but remarkably accurate. Though I must say, your analogies are quite unique."

As Mr. Aldrich continued his lecture, I found my mind wandering in that peculiar way it often did. The arrays and crystals he described seemed to rearrange themselves in my vision, like pieces of a puzzle shifting into more efficient patterns. Something about their flow felt wrong - like watching a melody played off-key.

Luna's hand shot up again, and I noticed how she braced her arm against the desk - a subtle movement that spoke volumes about her fatigue. "Sir, what about integrating fractal patterns into linear arrays? Couldn't that potentially amplify the output without increasing crystal load?"

The sparkle in her eyes couldn't quite mask the slight strain in her voice, but her mind was as sharp as ever. Mr. Aldrich's eyes lit up with interest, his monocle glinting in the morning light.

"An intriguing proposition, Miss Archi. How would you address the potential instability in such a configuration?"

As Luna launched into her explanation, my pen moved across paper almost on its own. Golden lines of energy danced in my mind, forming patterns that felt as natural as breathing yet as foreign as another language. Equations and diagrams flowed onto the paper, refining Luna's idea in ways that made perfect sense to me, even if I couldn't quite explain why.

"Nii-san," Luna whispered, her shoulder brushing mine as she leaned over. "What are you..." Her voice trailed off as she studied my notes, her brow furrowing in that way it did when she encountered something fascinating. The slight tremor in her hands had grown more noticeable, though she tried to hide it by gripping her pen tighter.

"I... I'm not sure," I admitted softly. "It just came to me."

Mr. Aldrich's voice cut through our whispered exchange. "Mr. Archi, would you care to share your thoughts with the class?"

The weight of expectant gazes pressed against me as I stood, clutching my notes. Luna gave me an encouraging nod, though I noticed how she used the moment to take a careful, measured breath - the kind she took when trying to gather strength.

"I was... expanding on Luna's idea, sir." My voice grew steadier as I focused on the familiar dance of energy patterns in my mind. "If we introduce a cascading resonance pattern here," I gestured to the board, trying to translate my strange intuition into terms they'd understand, "it would work like... like ripples in a pond, each wave supporting the next. The fractal integration stabilizes itself through these repeated patterns."

The classroom fell silent. Mr. Aldrich adjusted his monocle, studying my hastily sketched diagram with an intensity that made me want to sink back into my chair. The familiar anxiety crept up my spine until Luna's hand brushed against mine under the desk - a gesture of support that steadied me.

"This is... remarkably innovative, Vixia. Where did you learn this technique?"

Heat rose to my cheeks. "I didn't, sir. It just... made sense to me." Like so many things did, in ways I could never quite explain.

Luna beamed up at me, though I noticed how she leaned back in her chair, her shoulders tense with hidden exhaustion. "See? I told you you're brilliant, Nii-san. You just need to speak up more!"

As I sat back down, the weight of curious stares pressed against my back. Luna leaned in, her voice low and excited despite the slight catch in her breath. "We are so working on this later. I bet we could build a prototype!"

Mr. Aldrich cleared his throat, drawing attention back to the front of the room. "Now, I have an exciting announcement. We'll be starting a group project today."

The classroom erupted in a mix of groans and excited whispers. Luna's eyes met mine, a mischievous glint replacing the fatigue that had been creeping into them. I recognized that look - it usually preceded either brilliance or chaos, often both.

"Each team will consist of four students," Mr. Aldrich continued, the crystals in his monocle catching the morning light. "Your task will be to design and prototype a novel application of Array Circuits."

Luna's hand shot up, though I noticed how it trembled slightly before she steadied it against the desk. "Sir, can we choose our own teams?"

"No, Miss Archi. I'll be assigning the groups myself."

Luna turned to me, and despite the shadows under her eyes, her competitive spirit blazed bright. "Bet I can make a better prototype than you, Nii-san," she whispered, but her challenging tone couldn't quite mask the slight wheeze in her breath.

My chest tightened with familiar worry, but I played along, knowing how much she hated being coddled. "We'll see about that," I murmured back, already planning ways to suggest designs that wouldn't tax her too much.

Mr. Aldrich began calling out names. "Team One: Luna Archi, Vixia Archi..."

Luna's jaw dropped in theatrical surprise, and I couldn't help but smile at her expression. She recovered quickly, her determination shifting into something more collaborative. The tension in her shoulders eased slightly - whether from relief at working together or simple exhaustion, I couldn't tell.

"...Elara Frost and Zain Ember," Mr. Aldrich finished.

I glanced toward our new teammates. Elara sat near the window, her silvery hair catching the morning light in ways that reminded me of Luminar crystal refractions. Her sharp green eyes met mine with quiet intensity, and something in her gaze suggested she noticed more than she let on. When her attention shifted to Luna, her expression flickered with what might have been recognition - not of Luna herself, but perhaps of something in her careful movements.

Zain, by contrast, was all motion and energy. His wild red hair seemed to defy gravity as he pumped his fist in excitement, freckles dancing across his grinning face. "Yes! We got the Archi siblings!" he exclaimed, his voice carrying across the room. "This is gonna be awesome!"

"Yes! We got the Archi siblings!" Zain bounced up from his seat, wild red hair catching the morning light. "This is gonna be awesome!"

I felt a flutter of anxiety at his enthusiasm, but Luna seemed to feed off it, straightening in her seat despite her earlier fatigue. "Of course it will be," she declared, though I noticed how her hand pressed against the desk for support as she turned to face our new teammates. "We're going to make something incredible."

Elara raised an eyebrow, her voice soft but clear. "Perhaps we should discuss our approach first?" Her sharp green eyes flickered between Luna and me, lingering for a moment on Luna's white-knuckled grip on her desk. "I have some thoughts about energy conservation in spiral arrays."

Luna's expression tightened - the same look she got whenever someone suggested taking things slower. "We don't need to be that cautious. I was thinking we could-"

"Actually," I cut in, recognizing the stubborn set of Luna's jaw, "energy conservation might help with the stability issues in your fractal integration idea."

She shot me a glare, but the slight tremor in her hands betrayed her exhaustion. After a moment, she huffed. "Fine. But we're not playing it safe with everything."

As we huddled together, Zain practically vibrating with excitement beside us, I watched Luna's expression shift from reluctant to intrigued. Her initial resistance melted as Elara quietly outlined her ideas, each one building on Luna's original concept while making it more efficient.

"What if we made the array spin?" Zain blurted out suddenly, his hands whirling through the air. "Like, physically spin!"

Luna paused mid-sentence, her pen hovering over her notebook. A snort escaped before she could catch it. "Zain, arrays don't..." she started, then stopped, her eyes widening. I recognized that look - the one that meant her mind was racing ahead, seeing possibilities others might miss.

"Actually," Elara's soft voice cut through Luna's contemplation, "rotational energy could enhance mana flow in certain configurations."

Luna's head snapped up. "Wait, really?" Her earlier fatigue seemed forgotten as she leaned forward, eyes bright. "Nii-san, wouldn't that work with your ripple theory from earlier?"

I blinked, surprised by her sudden enthusiasm. The familiar patterns danced in my mind, rearranging themselves with this new possibility. "It... might actually stabilize the whole system," I admitted, already sketching out the concept.

"Ha!" Luna's triumphant grin carried a hint of her usual competitiveness. "See? Sometimes the weird ideas are the best ones." She paused, glancing at my growing diagram. "Though your layout needs work. Here-" She reached for my paper, then stopped, her hand trembling slightly.

Elara smoothly slid her own notebook forward. "Perhaps we could combine both approaches?" Her calm suggestion drew attention away from Luna's moment of weakness - something about her manner suggested it wasn't entirely coincidental.

Zain leapt from his seat, nearly knocking over his chair. "Yes! Spinning arrays for the win!" he shouted, drawing curious stares from nearby groups.

Mr. Aldrich cleared his throat from across the room. "Mr. Ember, please contain your enthusiasm to a more... classroom-appropriate level."

"Sorry, sir!" Zain grinned, not looking sorry at all as he plopped back into his seat. His energy seemed to fill our corner of the classroom, making even Elara's lips twitch into a slight smile.

As we delved deeper into our design, something felt different. Each time I started to hesitate over a calculation, Luna would click her tongue impatiently. "Just draw it already, Nii-san," she'd mutter, though her eyes tracked my movements with keen interest.

I sketched out another modification, and Luna leaned forward, her breath catching slightly. She pressed her palm flat against the desk - a gesture I recognized as her way of steadying herself. Her eyes narrowed at my diagram, and for a moment, I thought she'd dismiss it.

"That's..." she started, then pressed her lips together. "Actually not terrible." The words came out reluctantly, but there was a glimmer of pride in her eyes before she quickly looked away. "Though if we adjusted the flow here-" Her hand trembled as she reached for the paper.

Elara's quiet voice cut in smoothly. "What if we combined that with a stabilizing matrix?" She slid her notebook closer to Luna, providing support for her shaking hand without drawing attention to it. "Like this?"

Luna's shoulders relaxed slightly, though her competitive spirit flickered back to life. "That could work, but watch this-" She began sketching rapidly, her strokes confident despite her fatigue.

Zain bounced in his seat, scattering papers. "Oh! And if we add another crystal here-" he jabbed at the diagram, his enthusiasm making Luna snatch the paper away protectively.

"Careful! You'll smudge the-" She broke off, her breath hitching. For a moment, her face paled.

I reached for her arm, but she shot me a warning look. *Don't you dare*, it said clearly. Instead, I pointed to a section of her design. "The energy flow might be too intense there," I said quietly. "What if we redistributed it through these secondary nodes?"

She stared at me for a moment, understanding flickering across her face. "Fine," she muttered, though her grip on the pencil loosened slightly. "But we're keeping the core design."

Elara's observant gaze moved between us, her expression thoughtful. "The secondary nodes could actually enhance the rotation effect," she offered, her soft voice carrying a note of gentle approval. "Especially if we layer them like this-" Her elegant script filled the margins of our diagram, adding depth to our concept without overwhelming it.

Our group fell into a rhythm after that. Luna's brilliant ideas would spark a direction, Zain's wild enthusiasm would push boundaries, Elara's careful refinements would make them possible, and my strange intuitions would tie it all together. When Luna's energy would flag, Elara would mysteriously need time to double-check calculations, or Zain would burst into another excited tangent, giving her moments to recover without acknowledging them.

"You know," Luna said during one such pause, her voice carrying a mix of reluctance and pride, "this might actually be better than what I would have done alone." She glanced at me, adding quickly, "Don't let it go to your head, Nii-san."

I sketched out another modification, my hand pausing briefly over a complex intersection point. Luna leaned forward, her breath catching slightly. She pressed her palm flat against the desk - a gesture I'd seen countless times when she needed to steady herself. Her eyes narrowed at my diagram, and I found myself wanting to redraw it.

"That's..." she started, then pressed her lips together. "Actually not terrible." The words came out reluctantly, but there was a glimmer in her eyes before she quickly looked away. "Though if we adjusted the flow here-" Her hand trembled as she reached for the paper.

Elara's quiet voice cut in smoothly. "What if we combined that with a stabilizing matrix?" She slid her notebook closer to Luna, providing support for her shaking hand without drawing attention to it. "Like this?"

Luna's shoulders relaxed slightly, though her competitive spirit flickered back to life. "That could work, but watch this-" She began sketching rapidly, her strokes confident despite her fatigue.

Zain bounced in his seat, scattering papers. "Oh! And if we add another crystal here-" he jabbed at the diagram, his enthusiasm making Luna snatch the paper away protectively.

"Careful! You'll smudge the-" She broke off, her breath hitching. For a moment, her face paled.

My hand moved toward her arm before I caught myself. Luna shot me a warning look that could have frozen a fire crystal. Instead, I pointed to a section of her design. "The energy flow might be too intense there," I said quietly. "What if we redistributed it through these secondary nodes?"

She stared at me for a moment, something unspoken passing between us. "Fine," she muttered, though her grip on the pencil loosened slightly. "But we're keeping the core design."

Elara's observant gaze moved between us, her expression thoughtful. "The secondary nodes could actually enhance the rotation effect," she offered, her soft voice carrying a note of gentle approval. "Especially if we layer them like this-" Her elegant script filled the margins of our diagram, adding depth to our concept without overwhelming it.

Strange patterns danced in my mind as we worked, like fragments of a half-remembered dream. Each time I started to question them, Luna would make an impatient sound or Zain would burst into another excited tangent, pulling me back into the flow of creation. When Luna's energy would flag, Elara would mysteriously need time to double-check calculations, or Zain would launch into elaborate theories about spinning crystals, giving her moments to recover without acknowledging them.

"You know," Luna said during one such pause, her voice carrying a mix of reluctance and pride, "this might actually be better than what I would have done alone." She glanced at me, adding quickly, "Don't let it go to your head, Nii-san."

The morning light shifted across our desks as we refined our design. Luna's breathing grew more labored, though she tried to hide it behind excited explanations and sharp critiques. Each time I opened my mouth to suggest a break, she'd cut me off with a new idea or a challenging glare.

Elara caught my eye, her sharp green gaze flickering to Luna and back. Without a word, she began gathering her notes. "Perhaps we should organize our documentation for next class," she suggested softly. "Mr. Aldrich will want a detailed progress report."

Luna started to protest, but Zain's enthusiastic agreement drowned her out. "Oh man, we need to make this presentation amazing! Maybe we could make the diagrams spin too!"

As the others packed up their materials, Luna's shoulders sagged slightly. "This was... not terrible," she admitted, her voice low enough that only I could hear. "Your weird ideas actually helped." She paused, straightening her papers with careful precision. "Just... don't start doubting them again, okay? It's annoying."

Before I could respond, she'd already turned away, but her words lingered in the air between us - half challenge, half something else entirely.

The classroom buzzed with activity as other groups began wrapping up their discussions. Mr. Aldrich moved between tables, his monocle glinting as he reviewed each team's progress. When he reached our group, his eyebrows rose at our diagram.

"Most... intriguing," he murmured, studying the complex array of spinning patterns and fractal integrations. "Though I must admit, some of these configurations are rather unorthodox." His gaze lingered on my sketches, head tilting slightly.

Luna straightened in her seat, her exhaustion momentarily masked by pride. "The unorthodox parts are what make it brilliant, sir." She shot me a quick glance. "Even if the explanations behind them are weird."

"Indeed," Mr. Aldrich adjusted his monocle. "I look forward to seeing your prototype. Remember, you'll need to demonstrate a working model by next week."

As he moved away, Luna's confident posture wavered slightly. She pressed one hand against the desk, using the motion of gathering her papers with the other to hide how she steadied herself.

"We should meet to start building tomorrow," she declared, though her voice carried a slight tremor. "The sooner we-"

"The workshop will be crowded tomorrow," Elara interrupted smoothly. "Perhaps the day after? That would give us time to properly source the materials we need."

Luna's eyes narrowed, but before she could argue, Zain bounced up from his seat. "Oh! And I can ask my uncle about getting some higher-grade crystals! He works at the Harmonic Foundries, you know. Though it might take a day or two..."

I watched Luna's expression shift from frustration to reluctant acceptance. She couldn't argue against better materials, even if it meant waiting.

"Fine," she conceded, stuffing her notes into her bag with more force than necessary. "But we're not wasting any time once we start. This has to be perfect."

The morning bell chimed, its resonant tone signaling the end of class. As students filed out, Luna lingered, her movements deliberately slow. I pretended to be absorbed in organizing my papers, waiting.

"Stop hovering," she muttered, but didn't move away. "I'm fine."

"I know," I replied, though my eyes caught the slight tremor in her fingers as she closed her bag. "I just want to make sure I didn't forget any notes."

She snorted, seeing through the excuse easily. "Your weird array ideas are already memorized in that strange head of yours." Her tone was sharp, but as she stood, she let her shoulder brush against mine - a brief moment of contact that said more than her words. "Just make sure you actually use them when we build this thing. I hate it when you..." she trailed off, shaking her head. "Never mind. Come on, we'll be late for resonance practice."

As we left the classroom, I noticed Elara watching us from the doorway, her piercing green eyes thoughtful. She nodded once, a gesture that seemed to carry understanding beyond simple farewell, before disappearing into the crowd of students.

Luna's pace was slower than usual as we navigated the busy hallway, though she covered it well with sharp comments about our classmates' project ideas. I matched her stride without comment, letting her words fill the space between us.

### Chapter 4

Vixia and Luna attend Ms. Lyra's Resonance studies class. Ms. Lyra explains that first summons serve as introductions to transcendent beings, who observe potential Resonators before forming link resonance. The class learns about compatibility requirements and how Resonance can help humans overcome their natural magical limitations.

---

As Luna and I made our way to Ms. Lyra's class, I found myself anticipating today's practical demonstration. Despite having read extensively about Resonance theory, seeing the actual principles demonstrated always revealed new insights. Luna, on the other hand, trudged along with noticeably less enthusiasm.

"I still don't get why this class is mandatory," she grumbled, adjusting her bag. "It's not like everyone's going to become a Resonator."

"Because understanding Resonance principles can improve other magical applications," I replied, falling into the familiar pattern of our debates. "Even your engineering could benefit from—"

"Leave it to you to find the practical angle, Nii-san," Luna cut me off with an eye roll, but I caught her slight smile.

The classroom door opened to a wash of gentle warmth, the ambient temperature always a few degrees higher than the hallway due to the active crystals Ms. Lyra used in her demonstrations. The familiar scent of sun-warmed brass and ozone filled the air—the telltale signature of recently activated Luminar arrays. Afternoon light streamed through the tall windows, catching dust motes that danced like tiny stars in its beam.

Ms. Lyra stood at the demonstration table, her black hair catching the light as she arranged an intricate pattern of crystals. Their soft pulses of light painted shifting shadows across the worn wooden floors, creating an almost hypnotic rhythm. Around us, other students settled into their seats, their whispered conversations creating a gentle buzz of anticipation. A few of them, I noticed, were already leaning forward, eyes fixed on the crystal arrangement—clearly, I wasn't the only one intrigued by today's setup.

"Today," Ms. Lyra announced, her voice carrying easily through the room, "we'll be examining the first summon ritual in greater detail. Most of you understand its basic purpose—attempting to establish initial contact with transcendent beings. However, today we'll explore one of the greatest mysteries that our scholars only recently began to unravel."

I straightened in my seat, feeling the familiar excitement building in my chest. Even after all my research, there was still so much unknown about Resonance. Beside me, Luna had slouched in her chair, but her pen was poised over her notebook—a sure sign she was at least partially interested.

Ms. Lyra touched one of the crystals, sending a ripple of golden light through the array. "For generations, we believed the first summon's overwhelming failure rate—99.9%—was simply the harsh reality of seeking transcendent links. Even the Vessels themselves rarely spoke of it, bound by laws and limitations we're only beginning to understand." She paused, letting the crystal's light cast intricate patterns across the ceiling. "But recent studies of successful Resonators have revealed something extraordinary."

The crystal's light pulsed stronger, forming shapes reminiscent of ethereal creatures. A collective gasp rose from the class. Even Luna's pen stilled.

"Each 'failed' attempt," Ms. Lyra continued, her voice filled with wonder, "leaves an echo in the transcendence realm. Like a fingerprint of the soul, unique to each person. Through careful research and rare testimonies from both Resonators and their Vessels, we've learned that transcendent beings can sense these echoes, allowing them to observe potential partners from their realm."

She adjusted the crystals, creating two distinct light patterns that danced around each other. "When a Vessel notices an echo that interests them, they may choose to observe the person more closely. This observation period can last anywhere from days to years. They watch how the person acts, how they handle challenges, how they treat others—everything that makes up their true nature."

"But Ms. Lyra," I ventured, connecting this with my previous studies, "why wouldn't the Vessels share this knowledge directly? Surely it would help potential Resonators understand the process better?"

A few heads turned my way, and I heard someone whisper, "Trust Archi to ask the complicated questions." But Ms. Lyra's eyes sparkled with approval.

"Another excellent question, Vixia. The transcendent realm operates under different laws than ours. Many Vessels are bound by restrictions we don't fully comprehend. They can guide us once linked, but cannot freely share certain knowledge about the nature of their realm or the link resonance process itself."

She gestured to where the two light patterns circled each other, never quite meeting. "But perhaps the most crucial aspect we've learned is about compatibility itself. It's not a choice—it's a fundamental resonance between souls. Even if both a Vessel and a potential Resonator desperately wish to link resonance, if their essences don't naturally align, the link simply cannot form. Think of it like two different musical notes—you can't force them to harmonize if they're fundamentally discordant."

The light patterns finally merged, creating a brilliant new color. "When true compatibility exists, the link forms naturally, like two perfectly matched notes creating a harmony. This is why some people might try for years without success, while others form links almost immediately. It's not about worthiness or effort—it's about finding that natural resonance."

Luna's hand shot up suddenly, her earlier disinterest forgotten. "So theoretically, if we could understand how these 'echoes' work, could we enhance them? Maybe through specialized crystal arrays?"

I glanced at my sister, recognizing the familiar glint in her eye—she'd found an engineering puzzle to solve. Around us, several students straightened, including Zain who practically bounced in his seat, clearly excited by the possibility. Even Elara, usually silent and observant, turned her piercing green eyes toward Luna with interest.

Ms. Lyra's expression turned thoughtful as she adjusted the crystal formation. The light patterns shifted again, creating a mesmerizing dance of geometric shapes. "An intriguing theory, Luna. However, attempts to artificially influence these echoes have proven... challenging. There are documented cases where such attempts actually diminished the chance of forming a bond."

"But why?" Zain burst out, unable to contain himself. His enthusiasm, as always, was infectious. "If we can understand it, shouldn't we be able to work with it?"

"Think of it like trying to make yourself more appealing by wearing a mask," Ms. Lyra explained, the crystals' light dimming slightly. "The very act of artificial enhancement might obscure the true essence that a Vessel seeks to observe."

I noticed Elara's slight nod at this explanation, her silvery hair catching the crystal light as she made a brief note in her notebook. Luna frowned, tapping her pen against her notebook—I could practically see the gears turning in her head, likely already formulating counter-arguments.

"Ms. Lyra," I began, choosing my words carefully, "the texts mention that human Resonators often achieve capabilities far beyond normal human limitations. But they're vague about how this actually works. Is it simply the Vessel's power flowing through us, or does something fundamentally change within the human Resonator?"

The crystal array pulsed with renewed intensity, as if responding to my question. Ms. Lyra smiled, her violet eyes reflecting the dancing lights. "Consider this," she said, adjusting the crystals to form a new pattern. Two lights began to orbit each other, their colors gradually blending where they intersected. "When a human forms a Resonance bond, it's not just about channeling the Vessel's power. The bond creates something entirely new—a synthesis of human adaptability and transcendent energy."

She gestured to where the lights had merged into a brilliant new color. "This is why human Resonators sometimes achieve things that surprise even their Vessels. Our very limitations, our need to understand and adapt, can lead to unprecedented applications of transcendent power."

The air hummed with a different frequency now, making the hair on my arms stand up. From the corner of my eye, I noticed Luna subtly pressing her hand against her chest, her breathing slightly labored. My concern must have shown on my face because she quickly straightened up, shooting me a warning glance.

"But," Ms. Lyra continued, her voice drawing my attention back to the demonstration, "this same adaptability makes the selection process crucial for Vessels. They must find partners whose natural essence—not just their abilities or ambitions—aligns with their own nature."

"What about the First Human Resonator?" Luna's voice cut through the quiet that had fallen over the classroom. "The texts say they formed multiple bonds—how does that fit with this matching process?"

The classroom fell silent. Even Zain stilled, his usual energy focused entirely on Ms. Lyra's response. Elara's gaze sharpened with interest.

Ms. Lyra's expression grew more serious, though her eyes retained their warm light. The crystal array shifted, its light dimming to a softer glow that cast long shadows across the room.

"Ah, now that touches on one of our greatest mysteries. The First Human Resonator possessed what we call Omni-Resonance—an ability so rare it's never been fully replicated. Their echo in the transcendence realm was said to be unique, capable of harmonizing with multiple Vessels simultaneously."

"Like a master instrument that can play any melody?" Zain interjected, practically vibrating with excitement.

Ms. Lyra smiled at his enthusiasm. "An apt metaphor, Zain. But remember," she cautioned, her voice gentle but firm, "extraordinary exceptions don't invalidate the general principle. Most successful Resonances come from genuine compatibility, not from trying to replicate exceptional cases."

"Then why even tell us about it?" Elara's quiet voice drew everyone's attention. Her green eyes reflected the crystal light as she continued, "If it's impossible to replicate, what's the purpose of studying it?"

"An excellent question." Ms. Lyra adjusted the crystal array again, creating a complex web of interconnected light patterns. "The First Human Resonator showed us what was possible—that humans, despite our perceived limitations, could achieve extraordinary things through Resonance. Their legacy isn't about replication, but about potential."

The air hummed with a different frequency now, making the hair on my arms stand up. From the corner of my eye, I noticed Luna subtly pressing her hand against her chest, her breathing slightly labored. My concern must have shown on my face because she quickly straightened up, shooting me a warning glance.

"Their achievement," Ms. Lyra continued, "also revealed something crucial about the nature of Resonance itself. The fact that one human could harmonize with multiple Vessels proved that compatibility isn't just about power or ability—it's about something far more fundamental in our nature."

A chime echoed through the halls—end of class. As students began gathering their things, their excited whispers filling the air, Ms. Lyra raised her voice slightly. "Remember, understanding these principles is crucial whether or not you pursue Resonance yourself. The same laws of compatibility and authentic connection apply to many aspects of magic."

As we packed up our bags, Luna nudged me. "Hey, Nii-san," she whispered, her eyes bright with that dangerous sparkle that usually meant she had an idea. "What if the problem isn't about enhancing the echo, but about understanding it better? Maybe if we could just—"

"Luna," I warned, recognizing the tone that usually preceded one of her more ambitious experiments.

"What?" She grinned, already pulling out her notebook. "I'm not saying we try to replicate Omni-Resonance. I'm just thinking about the observation process itself. If Vessels can observe us through these echoes, there must be some kind of... I don't know, pattern or principle we could study."

"Some things aren't meant to be engineered," Elara's soft voice came from behind us, making Luna jump slightly. "Sometimes observation itself changes what's being observed."

"But that's exactly my point!" Luna spun around, her earlier fatigue forgotten in her excitement. "If observation changes things, then understanding how and why—"

"Come on, Luna," I interrupted gently, noting how she was still pressing one hand against her chest despite her enthusiasm. "We'll be late for our next class."

Zain bounded up to us, grinning. "Late is better than never showing up! Besides, Luna might be onto something here. What if—"

"All of you," Ms. Lyra's voice carried from the front of the room, though her eyes twinkled with amusement, "should indeed head to your next class. Though I appreciate your enthusiasm for the subject."

As we filed out of the classroom, I couldn't help but notice how Luna's notebook was already filling with diagrams and calculations. Despite my concerns about her health, I felt a familiar warmth in my chest. My sister might dismiss Resonance studies as mandatory curriculum, but once her mind latched onto a puzzle, there was no stopping her.

I just hoped her latest idea wouldn't involve too many experimental arrays. We still hadn't fully repaired the scorch marks from her last "theoretical exploration."

* * *

I followed Luna out of Ms. Lyra's classroom, my mind still reeling from the discussion about Resonance. We made our way to the next class, our feet carrying us through the winding corridors of our school. The sun was high overhead, casting a warm glow over the campus. We were headed to a class on the Magic System, a subject I was both fascinated and intimidated by.

As we stepped out into the field, I felt a sense of excitement wash over me. The instructor, Mr. Kael, stood at the edge of the clearing, his eyes scanning the group. He was a tall, imposing figure with a kind face and a passion for teaching.

"Welcome, students," he boomed, his voice carrying across the field. "Today, we're going to explore the Magic System in a more hands-on way. We'll be working with Aether, the refined mana that powers our magic."

### SECTION BREAK

Despite her worsening health, Luna pushes herself to continue working on her inventions, refusing to let her condition define her. At the academy, her disengagement coqntrasts sharply with Vixia’s focus, raising his concerns. Luna deflects his questions with sharp humor, but her facade cracks when she collapses in her workshop after overexerting herself. As Vixia rushes her to get help, the weight of her condition becomes undeniable, leaving him determined to uncover the truth behind her struggles.

### Chapter 6

The siblings meet Haris, a Resonator physician, who delivers a grim diagnosis: Luna’s Chrysalis is fragile, unable to regenerate mana safely, and her remaining lifespan is likely no more than six years. Resonance, while potentially life-saving, poses too great a risk. Struggling with this revelation, Vixia hides the full truth from Luna, pretending all is well. However, her teasing humor cannot mask her growing suspicions. Haunted by Haris’s warning, Vixia silently vows to find a way to save her, no matter how impossible it seems.

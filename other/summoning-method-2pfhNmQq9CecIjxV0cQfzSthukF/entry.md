## Summoning Method Details :

### First Summon - The Introduction

- The first summoning attempt serves as a spiritual "beacon" into the transcendence realm
- This initial attempt has a 99.9% failure rate by design
- Functions as a metaphysical "introduction card" to the transcendent beings
- Consumes minimal Chrysalis energy compared to subsequent attempts
- Leaves a lasting "spiritual signature" in the transcendence realm

### Transcendent Observation Period

- After the first summon, interested transcendent beings may:
  - Observe the summoner from their realm
  - Study the summoner's character, actions, and potential
  - Evaluate compatibility for possible Resonance
- This observation period is completely undetectable to the summoner
- Can last anywhere from days to years, depending on the transcendent being's interest

### Success Rate Factors

The 5% success rate for summoning is influenced by multiple factors:
1. **Transcendent Interest**
   - Only a small percentage of transcendent beings actively seek Resonators
   - Each transcendent being has specific criteria for potential partners
   - Most ignore summoning attempts entirely
2. **Sync Rate Requirements**
   - Even with mutual interest, both parties must meet minimum synchronization thresholds
   - Sync rate factors include:
     - Spiritual compatibility
     - Personality alignment
     - Purpose/goal harmony
     - Natural affinity
3. **Timing Alignment**
   - The transcendent being must be:
     - Present in the area of the summoning
     - Willing to respond at that specific moment
     - Not engaged in other activities

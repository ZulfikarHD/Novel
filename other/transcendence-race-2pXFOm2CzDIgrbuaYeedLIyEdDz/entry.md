In a dimension separate from Esnar's material plane, three ancient and powerful races dwell—the Ethereals, Elementals, and Mytichal Beasts. These Transcendence races exist in a realm rich with pure mana, where reality itself bends to their presence and time flows differently than in the mortal world.

When these beings choose to form Link Resonance with mortals from Esnar, they grant extraordinary abilities to their chosen partners. However, such bonds are rare and dangerous to forge, especially for humans past their eighteenth year. The power bestowed varies greatly—Ethereals grant cosmic awareness and reality manipulation, Elementals share their command over nature, and Mytichal Beasts imbue their resonators with overwhelming physical or magical might and divine protection.

Should a vessel fall into the Strayed state, they enter a dormant phase unique to their race, becoming one with their dimension until fate or circumstance awakens them once more.

Luminar Crystals form the backbone of Esnar's magical and technological advancements, harnessed through intricate arrays and precise construction techniques to power everything from transportation to industrial systems.

### **Integration Methods**

1. **Crystal Mounting:** Crystals are set in durable alloy frames.
2. **Array Circuits:** Multiple crystals connected for enhanced functionality.
3. **Resonance Chambers:** Amplification through enclosed crystal interactions.

### **Construction Rules**

Precise geometry, proportionate crystals, pure conductors, and balanced energy flows are essential for safe and effective designs.

### **Common Issues**

Misalignment, pattern disruption, and material degradation can lead to resonance interference or catastrophic energy overflow.

### **1. Ground Genius or Prodigy Traits in Action, Not Words**

Characters who are "geniuses" or "prodigy" should demonstrate intellect through actions, problem-solving, or clever decisions rather than constant exposition or overly technical speech.

**DO:**
- Show intelligence through creative problem-solving in moments of tension or relevance.
- Use practical intuition to hint at their intellect in casual, everyday tasks.
- Example: *Luna spots a glitch in a mana device and fixes it on the fly, saying,* “Fixed. Honestly, I should start charging for these little miracles.”

**DON’T:**
- Overload dialogue with unnecessary jargon or unnatural explanations.
- Example of what to avoid: “Based on my calculations, the resonance flow of this device is 4.32 megajoules per second!”

---

### **2. Keep Technical Jargon Contextual and Minimal**

Balance complex terms with relatable phrasing and reserve jargon for moments of dramatic or humorous effect.

**DO:**
- Use metaphors or relatable terms to simplify explanations.
- Example: Instead of: “The resonance coefficient is misaligned with the energy flux.” Try: “The magic’s out of sync; I’ll recalibrate it—just watch.”

**DON’T:**
- Force jargon into dialogue without context or relevance.

---

### **((3. Show, Don’t Tell**

Reveal emotions, relationships, and world mechanics through action, dialogue, and sensory details like sight, sound, smell and touch rather than blunt statements.

**DO:**
- Show emotions through body language and reactions. Example: *Telling:* "Vixia was worried about Luna’s health but didn’t say anything." *Showing:* *Luna straightened from her workbench, her movements slow. Her hand brushed briefly against her chest, as though steadying herself. The faint tremor in her fingers caught Vixia’s eye. She clenched her hand into a fist, smirking quickly, but the tension settled heavy in Vixia’s chest, like inhaling the wrong note of mana oil.*

**DON’T:**
- State emotions or world mechanics bluntly.))

---

### **4. Reveal World Mechanics Through Immersion**

Integrate worldbuilding naturally into scenes or dialogue without info-dumping.

**DO:**
- Let characters interact with or notice world details as part of the scene. Example: *The mana crystals shimmered in their brass fixtures, their golden light casting shifting patterns on the walls. A low hum filled the air, steady and rhythmic, though my ears caught the faintest stutter in its pulse—so subtle most wouldn’t notice, but enough to leave me uneasy.*

**DON’T:**
- Deliver world mechanics in exposition-heavy blocks. Example of what to avoid: “Mana crystals power technology, and they have a steady hum when functioning properly.”

---

### **5. Show Youthful and Relatable Personality**

Give characters, especially younger ones, moments that reflect their humanity, age, and quirks.

**DO:**
- Highlight hobbies, playful banter, or moments of vulnerability.
- Example: *Luna snatched a cookie mid-experiment and grinned,* “Fuel for the genius brain.”

**DON’T:**
- Make children or young characters sound overly adult all the time.

---

### **6. Build Relational Dynamics Around Personality**

Let characters’ relationships highlight their traits organically.

**DO:**
- Use teasing, encouragement, or admiration to show relationships. Example: *Luna teased Vixia as he hesitated over the array.* “Come on, Nii-san! You’re too good at this to chicken out now.”
- Allow characters to acknowledge and learn from one another, showing growth.

**DON’T:**
- Make relationships repetitive (e.g., constant banter without change or development).

---

### **7. Balance Action, Exposition, and Emotion**

Ensure no single element overwhelms the scene or disrupts the pacing.

**DO:**
- Blend exposition into sensory or emotional descriptions. Example: *Through the frost-speckled window, the cliffs of the Raised Lands loomed against the twilight sky, their jagged edges glittering with crystalline scars left by the divine beast. A reminder of Judgment Day’s wrath—and the fragile peace that followed.*

**DON’T:**
- Stop the story for large, unintegrated blocks of lore.

---

### **8. Dialogue Reflects Personality and Advances the Plot**

Conversations should sound unique to the character while moving the story forward.

**DO:**
- Match dialogue to character personality and relationships. Example: *Vixia (Reserved, Thoughtful):* “I think... if you adjust the alignment of the fourth crystal, it might stabilize the flow. Just a little.” *Luna (Playful, Confident):* “It’s fine, Nii-san,” Luna quipped, twisting the brass ring sharply. Her smirk followed, quick and pointed. “Do you want to finish this for me? No? Then let me work.”

**DON’T:**
- Write generic or overly dramatic dialogue that doesn’t fit the character.

---

### **9. Foreshadow Subtly**

Introduce hints of future events or conflicts through minor, meaningful details.

**DO:**
- Use sensory details or small gestures to suggest underlying truths. Example: *Luna’s fingers lingered on the edge of the bench, her grip just firm enough to leave faint imprints. She exhaled, brushing her hair back as if the motion could erase the moment, but the tension in her shoulders lingered.*

**DON’T:**
- Spell out foreshadowing too plainly or abruptly. Example of what to avoid: “Luna’s mysterious illness was worsening, and Vixia couldn’t stop worrying about her.”

---

### **10. Write Through Perspective**

Reveal the world through the lens of the POV character’s thoughts, feelings, and observations.

**DO:**
- Let the character’s personality color the narration. Example (Vixia’s POV): *The room was quiet except for the faint clink of Luna’s tools and the hum of the crystals. I traced the energy flow in my mind, visualizing the array as lines of golden light weaving through the air. My fingertips brushed the brass housing, its cool surface warming faintly beneath the steady pulse of the mana. It felt alive, almost like it was breathing.*

**DON’T:**
- Add information the character wouldn’t know or notice.

---

### **11. Character Consistency**

Keep actions, thoughts, and dialogue aligned with established traits unless there’s a clear reason for deviation.

**DO:**
- Ensure personality shines in their behavior. Example: *Luna adjusted the crystal with a flourish, her smirk firmly in place.* “Nii-san, don’t look so surprised,” she teased. “Brilliance is kind of my thing.”

**DON’T:**
- Make characters act out of character without an explained reason. Example of inconsistency: *Luna sighed deeply, her voice heavy with self-doubt. “I don’t think I can fix this, Nii-san.”*

### **12. Engage All Five Senses in Scene Descriptions**

Immersing readers means tapping into sight, touch, smell, sound, and even taste. These details bring the world and characters' experiences to life.

**DO:**
- Use sensory details to enhance the mood and atmosphere.
- Focus on what a character *notices* based on their situation or mindset.
- Combine multiple senses for richer imagery, especially during high-stakes moments.

**Example (Balanced):** Vixia entered the workshop, the faint scent of heated metal and mana oil wrapping around him. The whir of gears clashed with the occasional hiss of steam. He ran his fingers over the brass contraption, its surface warm and smooth except for a single jagged edge. The golden light of the mana crystal bathed the room, sharp shadows dancing on the walls.

**DON’T:**
- Overwhelm readers with too many sensory details at once, making the scene hard to follow.
- Use sensory descriptions that feel generic or disconnected from the character’s perspective.

**Example (Overdone):** The air smelled of oil, brass, smoke, and ozone. Light flashed everywhere, dancing on walls. The floor was cold, the air hot, and the sound of clicking, hissing, and buzzing filled the room like a swarm of bees.

### **1. "Show, Don’t Tell"**

**Rule**: Reveal emotions, relationships, and world mechanics through actions, dialogue, and immersive descriptions, not blunt explanations.

**Example**:
- **Telling**: "Vixia was worried about Luna’s health but didn’t say anything."
- **Showing**: "Luna straightened from her workbench, but her movements were slow, her hand brushing briefly against her chest as though to steady herself. The faint tremor in her fingers caught my eye, though she quickly clenched her hand into a fist, her smirk back in place. The tension settled heavy in my chest, as if I’d inhaled the wrong note of the mana oil in the air."

### **2. "Reveal World Mechanics Through Immersion"**

**Rule**: Integrate lore, magic, and worldbuilding naturally into scenes or dialogue without info-dumping. Let readers experience the world through the characters’ interactions and environment.

**Example**:
- **Telling**: "Mana crystals power technology, and they have a steady hum when functioning properly."
- **Showing**: "The mana crystals shimmered in their brass fixtures, their golden light casting shifting patterns on the walls. A low hum filled the air, steady and rhythmic, though my ears caught the faintest stutter in its pulse—so subtle most wouldn’t notice, but enough to leave me uneasy."

---

### **3. "Balance Action, Exposition, and Emotion"**

**Rule**: Ensure a balance between actions, world exposition, and characters’ emotional arcs. Keep each element working toward the story’s progression without overwhelming the reader.

**Example**:
- **Unbalanced (Exposition-heavy)**: "The Raised Lands are the remnants of Judgment Day, a catastrophe caused by the divine beast’s rampage. Their cliffs are dangerous but fascinating."
- **Balanced**: "Through the frost-speckled window, the cliffs of the Raised Lands loomed against the twilight sky, their jagged edges glittering with crystalline scars left by the divine beast. A reminder of Judgment Day’s wrath—and the fragile peace that followed."

---

### **4. "Dialogue Reflects Personality and Advances the Plot"**

**Rule**: Make dialogue distinct for each character and reflective of their personality. Use conversations to reveal relationships, drive the plot forward, or add subtle layers of conflict or affection.

**Example**:
- **Vixia (Thoughtful, Reserved)**: "I think... if you adjust the alignment of the fourth crystal, it might stabilize the flow. Just a little."
- **Luna (Playful, Competitive)**: "It’s fine, Nii-san," Luna quipped, twisting the brass ring sharply. Her smirk followed, quick and pointed. "Do you want to finish this for me? No? Then let me work."

---

### **5. "Foreshadow Subtly"**

**Rule**: Introduce hints of future events, conflicts, or truths through small details, allowing the reader to infer without explicitly revealing everything.

**Example (Foreshadowing Luna’s Illness)**:
- **Subtle**: "As Luna reached for the next tool, her hand paused briefly on the edge of the bench. Her fingertips pressed hard enough to leave faint imprints, and when she exhaled, the sound was barely audible over the hum of the array. She straightened quickly, brushing back her hair as though the motion could erase the moment, but the tension lingered in the air, sharper than the scent of mana oil."
- **Overt**: "Luna’s mysterious illness was worsening, and Vixia couldn’t stop worrying about her."

---

### **6. "Write Through Perspective"**

**Rule**: Write scenes through the lens of the **current POV character**, revealing the world as they see and feel it. For Vixia, this means a mix of quiet introspection, observations, and his analytical mind. For others (third-person limited), show only what they notice or experience.

**Vixia’s POV (Thoughtful and Sensory)**:"The room was quiet except for the faint clink of Luna’s tools and the hum of the crystals. I traced the energy flow in my mind, visualizing the array as lines of golden light weaving through the air. My fingertips brushed the brass housing, its cool surface warming faintly beneath the steady pulse of the mana. It felt alive, almost like it was breathing."

---

### **7. "Balance Lore with Action"**

**Rule**: Incorporate lore and backstory into the characters’ immediate actions or reflections, keeping the narrative moving while deepening the world.

**Example**:
- **Lore Dump**: "The Archi family has a long history of Resonators, individuals who bond with beings from other realms called Vessels. Their role is to protect Esnar from the remnants of Judgment Day."
- **Balanced**: "Father’s hand rested on Ragnar’s scales, the golden veins beneath pulsing faintly in sync with his heartbeat. 'The Archi family has always stood at the border of chaos,' he said, his voice quiet. 'And we will continue to, as long as we stand together.'"

---

### **8. "Character Consistency"**

**Rule**: Keep characters’ actions, dialogue, and thoughts true to their established personalities. If a character acts out of character, show the reason behind the change.

**Example**:
- **Consistent Luna**: "Luna adjusted the crystal with a flourish, her smirk firmly in place. 'Nii-san, don’t look so surprised,' she teased. 'Brilliance is kind of my thing.'"
- **Inconsistent Luna** (without explanation): "Luna sighed deeply, her voice heavy with self-doubt. 'I don’t think I can fix this, Nii-san.'"

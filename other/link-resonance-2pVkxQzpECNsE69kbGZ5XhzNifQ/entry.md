**Definition:** Link Resonance is a ritual that binds the soul and body of a Resonator with a Vessel (a being of another race). This process reconstructs the Resonator’s body to harmonize with the Vessel’s power, enhancing their physical and magical attributes while maintaining their original form and appearance.

---

**Mechanics:**
1. **Body Reconstruction:**
   - The Resonator’s body adapts to match the Vessel’s strength but retains their original race and appearance (e.g., humans stay human).
   - Shared attributes include:
     - **Health and Constitution:** Only the stronger constitution or health is retained by both parties.
     - **Lifespan:** Both share the longer lifespan of the two.
   - **Skills:**
     - Combined and inherited skills create a unique skill for the Resonator.
     - Humans, lacking innate unique skills, unlock hidden abilities upon forming a Link Resonance.
2. **Requirements for Link Resonance:**
   - **Mutual Consent:** Both the Resonator and Vessel must agree, except for unborn beings like eggs.
   - **Resonance Rate:** A measure of compatibility between the two parties.

**Success Rates:**
- **By Race:**
  - The Virdaliths, with the highest success rate, achieve Resonance in 40% of attempts during their lifespan.
  - For humans, the chances are significantly lower:
    - **Summoning Method:** 5% success for humans under age 18 when bonding with transcendent races (spirits, dragons, ethereal beings).
    - **Direct Method:** 10% success but with additional risks.

**Methods of Link Resonance:**
1. **Summoning Method:**
   - Can be performed anywhere with the correct chant, but only under a full moon (when two moon showed).
   - Failure carries no severe penalties only almost depleted Chrysalis.
2. **Direct Method:**
   - Performed face-to-face with the Vessel.
   - Failure risks vary by individual but are non-lethal, with common outcomes including sickness or muscle soreness.
   - Unborn beings like eggs bypass the consent requirement.

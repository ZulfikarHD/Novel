
### Chapter 2

Vixia notices irregularities in the Luminar crystals' patterns and questions Luna's Array Circuit work. Luna dismisses Vixia's concerns while showing signs of physical strain. When Father arrives home, the family discusses Judgment Day and its historical significance. Mother and Syl eventually pull Luna away to help in the kitchen, while Vixia expresses worry about Luna's hidden condition to Father.

The Luminar crystals shimmered in their golden-metal frames, warm light spilling across the living room walls like woven threads. I sat cross-legged by the hearth, chin resting in my hand, gaze fixed on the faint flickers. Most would see gentle rhythm—steady, comforting. I saw something else.

The pattern broke. Each flicker carried dissonance that burrowed into my thoughts like a clock chiming out of time.

In my mind, the magic flow unraveled into crystalline shapes—sharp, precise. *Input, process, output.* The words whispered through my thoughts, a mantra I couldn't source. The meaning floated just out of reach. It wasn't logical, not entirely. Instinct. An intuitive understanding that didn't need explanation.

I reached out, fingers brushing the cool metal casing of the nearest crystal. A faint hum vibrated beneath my touch. The mana flow thrummed like a living heartbeat.

"The circuit's degrading," I murmured.

Behind me, Luna's tools clinked. The air carried the scent of polished metal and mana oil, mixing with the hearth's warmth. Her movements were deft as ever—hands a blur of precision as she adjusted the hexagonal array floating before her. Yet even in that fluid motion, a tremor caught my attention. A subtle pause between adjustments.

I tilted my head, studying her work from the corner of my eye.

"The fourth crystal—something's flowing backward instead of forward."

Luna's hand froze mid-air. She turned, calm expression giving way to sharp eyes and raised brow.

"It's balanced." She twisted a metal ring into place with force. Her tone carried the unspoken challenge: *Are you doubting me?*

I chose my words carefully. "If you adjusted the alignment... the feedback loop might—" I trailed off, the explanation slipping away. *Am I wrong? Maybe I'm just seeing patterns that aren't there.*

"It's fine." She snapped, voice firm but not unkind. That tone was her armor, polished for moments like these. She turned back to the array, smirk widening. "Nii-san, if you want to finish this for me, be my guest. Otherwise..." She twisted the ring. "Let me work."

The smirk said it all: *I've got this. Don't interfere.*

But I wasn't looking at her smirk. I was looking at the pallor of her cheeks, the tension in her movements. Her hand strayed to her chest—a motion so quick it might have gone unnoticed.

Not by me.

Silence settled between us. Luna's hands hovered over the array, fingers twitching as if fighting their own instinct.

"Unless..." she muttered, so quiet I almost missed it. "Unless the routing is backward..."

She shifted the fourth crystal. The array hummed to life, golden light pulsing in perfect synchronization.

"Ha!" Luna sat back, triumphant grin spreading across her face. "Knew I'd get it."

I smiled faintly.

She caught the expression, rolled her eyes. "Fine. Your weird idea helped." Her hand reached out, fingers delivering a gentle pinch to my arm. "Don't let it go to your head, Nii-san."

"I won't."

"Weirdo," she said, warmth threading through the tease.

The creak of the door broke the moment.

Father stepped in, coat dusted with frost, boots clicking on the wooden floor. Snowflakes clung to his dark hair, catching the crystal light. His sharp green eyes swept the room, lingering first on Luna, then me. Finding no immediate disaster, a quiet smile settled on his face.

"What's this?" he teased, setting a steaming mug on Luna's bench. "Another sibling rivalry?"

Luna straightened, brushing a strand of hair behind her ear. "It's not a rivalry." She twisted another ring, smirk softening. "I already won."

Father chuckled, leaning against the bench. "If you say so."

Through the frost-speckled window, the jagged cliffs of the Raised Lands loomed against twilight. Their edges gleamed with crystalline scars left by Judgment Day—beautiful but haunting. Silent witnesses to everything we'd lost. Everything we still didn't understand.

The thought slipped out before I could stop it.

"Do you ever think about what it must've been like? Standing against the beast, knowing you wouldn't win?"

Luna's hands froze for the briefest moment before resuming their work.

"They weren't fighting to win." Her voice was steady but distant. "They were desperate."

Father crossed the room, placing a hand on Luna's shoulder. His touch was light but grounding.

"Desperation doesn't diminish courage," he said. "It reveals it. Standing in the face of the impossible isn't about winning—it's about protecting what matters."

Ragnar, curled by the hearth in his diminished form, shifted. His obsidian-black scales absorbed the firelight. The faint glow of golden veins pulsed along his flank—steady, reassuring. His molten gold eyes regarded me with quiet wisdom.

"Judgment Day taught us that even despair can hold power," Ragnar rumbled. "Unity in adversity creates strength greater than any one individual."

I nodded, the weight of his words settling over me. I'd always admired the First Human Resonator—courage that defied expectations. Their actions weren't just history. They were the foundation of my dreams. One day, I wanted to stand as they had. Form a Resonance bond with a dragon and protect Esnar from the darkness that still threatened its edges.

Luna turned, catching my gaze with a raised eyebrow.

"You're doing it again, Nii-san." Her smirk softened into something warmer. "Getting all starry-eyed about history."

I smiled faintly. "Maybe. But there's nothing wrong with believing in what's worth fighting for."

Father chuckled, eyes crinkling at the corners as he stepped away from Luna's bench. "Ah, the Archi siblings—one dreaming of glory, the other inventing it. What a pair we've raised, Iruma."

Mother's voice drifted in from the hallway, light and melodic, with a faint teasing lilt.

"And yet they both forget to wash up before dinner, no matter how brilliant they are."

She entered the room with Syl padding beside her—the fox-like Vessel's crystalline fur casting faint rainbows across the walls. Syl's glowing eyes flicked toward Luna, three tails swishing as if in quiet observation.

Mother's silvery-white hair shimmered in the crystal light, creating a soft halo around her as she shrugged off her shawl and hung it near the hearth. Her amber gaze swept the room, lingering on Luna's workbench before settling on me.

"Have you two been at it all evening?"

Luna straightened, smirk returning. "Nii-san's been staring at crystals like they're going to confess their secrets." She gestured toward the hearth.

"I'm observing," I replied. The defensiveness in my tone made Luna snicker.

Mother smiled faintly, but her gaze sharpened as it shifted back to Luna.

"And you've been working long enough." Her voice was gentle. "Come help me in the kitchen, Luna. Syl can finish keeping an eye on your array."

Luna opened her mouth to protest but faltered when Syl hopped onto the bench beside her tools. The Vessel's glowing tails curled protectively around the array. Its silent gaze seemed to leave no room for argument. Mother's hand on Luna's shoulder reinforced the message.

"Fine," Luna muttered. She shot Syl an exaggerated suspicious look as she followed Mother out. "Just don't let it tinker with anything."

I watched them go, noting the faint stiffness in Luna's posture as she disappeared into the hallway. Syl tilted its head, luminescent eyes meeting mine briefly before turning back to the array.

"She'll be fine," Father said. His voice was quiet but certain as he moved to sit near the hearth. Ragnar shifted, lowering his head to rest on his massive foreclaw. His molten gaze remained fixed on me.

"Will she?" I asked. More to myself than anyone else.

Father's hand rested on my shoulder.

"Luna's stronger than you think," he said. "But strength isn't about ignoring weakness—it's about knowing when to rest and when to lean on others."

I glanced toward the kitchen. I could hear the soft clink of pots and pans, followed by Mother's calm voice giving instructions. Luna's replies were shorter, a little strained, though she still managed to sound playful when she teased Mother about over-seasoning.

"It's not just her," I said finally. Barely above a whisper. "She's always pushing herself. And she's hiding... something."

Father didn't reply immediately. Instead, he leaned back, watching the flicker of flames in the hearth.

"You're observant, Vixia," he said at last. "But sometimes what people need most isn't someone to fix their problems—it's someone to believe in their strength."

I wanted to argue. Point out the growing frequency of Luna's subtle gestures—her hand drifting to her chest, the pauses in her movements. But the weight of his words settled over me.

Ragnar's deep voice rumbled through the room.

"The greatest challenges are often those we cannot fight ourselves. Trust is as vital as courage, young one."

I nodded, though the feeling of helplessness lingered. It gnawed at the edges of my thoughts.

* * *

Mother and Luna prepare dinner together in the kitchen, with Luna measuring spices while learning about their magical properties. Vixia joins them reluctantly, helping with vegetables and checking the cooking array Luna modified. The family, including Father and Ragnar, gather for a peaceful dinner despite underlying tensions about Luna's health.

---

In the kitchen, Mother stood at the counter, hands moving in practiced motions as she chopped vegetables. Luna perched on a stool beside her, measuring spices into small metal bowls.

"A pinch more thyme," Mother suggested. Her amber eyes glowed faintly as she glanced at Luna's work. "Remember how it interacts with the rosemary?"

Luna's nose wrinkled in concentration.

"Right—they amplify each other." She adjusted the measurement with precision. "Like parallel circuits in an array."

Mother's laugh was soft and musical. "Trust you to find engineering in cooking." She paused her chopping to brush a strand of hair from Luna's face, touch lingering for just a moment. "Though you're not wrong. Everything connects, in its own way."

"Does that mean I can experiment?" Luna's eyes sparked with familiar mischief. "Maybe add some crystal dust for extra flavor?"

"Absolutely not," Mother replied, but her stern tone was betrayed by her smile. "The last time you 'experimented' in the kitchen, we had floating dumplings for a week."

Luna grinned, unrepentant. "They were still delicious though."

I watched from the doorway as Luna measured another spice. Her movements were precise despite her playful demeanor. Mother worked beside her, presence steady and calm, occasionally guiding Luna's hand or offering quiet suggestions. There was an ease between them—a gentle flow like perfectly aligned mana streams.

"The trick," Mother was saying, "is to let the flavors build naturally. You can't rush it, just like you can't rush an array's resonance."

Luna nodded, expression softening into something more thoughtful.

"Like waiting for the crystals to sync their frequencies?"

"Exactly." Mother's hand rested briefly on Luna's shoulder, squeezing. "Sometimes the most important part is having the patience to let things develop in their own time."

I shifted my weight against the doorframe. Luna's fingers traced the edge of another spice jar—precise movements, but I noticed the slight tremor in her hand as she lifted it. Before I could stop myself, I stepped forward.

"The coriander needs to be crushed first," I said quietly, reaching for the mortar and pestle. "It releases the oils better."

Luna's eyes narrowed. "I know that, Nii-san. I was getting to it."

"Here," Mother intervened, sliding the mortar toward Luna while giving me a knowing look. "Vixia's right about the technique, but I'm sure you remember from last time."

Heat crept up my neck. Mother—always the mediator—had a way of acknowledging both our perspectives without taking sides. Luna took the mortar with a small "hmph," but her movements as she crushed the seeds were careful, deliberate. Exactly the way Mother had taught us.

"Though I suppose crushing first does release more oils," Luna muttered under her breath, grinding the seeds with focused precision.

She glanced sideways at me. "You're such a weirdo about these tiny details."

Mother's soft laugh drifted between us. "He's thorough. There's a difference."

The kitchen filled with the sharp, citrusy scent of crushed coriander, mixing with other spices and the rich aroma of simmering broth. From my vantage point by the window, I noticed evening light glinting off Ragnar's scales as the dragon napped in the garden. His enormous body coiled protectively around Father's cherished plants.

"Vixia," Mother called me back, "could you see if the cooking array is at the right temperature? Luna changed it earlier, but I want to be sure it's staying consistent."

I nodded, thankful for the task. As I approached the stove, I sensed the shifts in mana flow around me. Like deciphering a code—each crystal's pulse revealed its own story.

I had to give Luna credit. Her modifications were smart. She'd made the heat flow more efficient—running multiple streams at once instead of one after another. Like... I paused, realizing what I'd just thought. *There I go again with the weird explanations.*

"It's stable," I reported, resisting the urge to launch into an explanation that neither of them would understand. Some battles weren't worth fighting, especially when the smell of dinner was making my stomach growl.

I watched Luna's hands move through the familiar motions of cooking. The way she handled spices reminded me of her engineering work—precise, confident, but always with a creative spark that made her uniquely Luna.

"You could come join us, Nii-san," Luna said without glancing my way, "instead of just standing there like a broken security alarm."

Mother glanced over her shoulder, smile warm and knowing. "There's plenty of work to go around."

I stepped into the kitchen, drawn by their invitation and the comfortable atmosphere. Scents of herbs and cooking filled the air, mingling with the subtle hum of the kitchen's crystal arrays. It was different from the workshop's sharp tang of mana oil and metal, but no less precise in its way.

"Here," Mother said, sliding a bowl of vegetables toward me. "These need to be diced. And Luna—"

"I know, I know," Luna cut in, weighing out another seasoning with theatrical precision. "No testing my new spellwork in tonight's dinner."

I settled into the familiar task, letting the knife find its steady pattern. There was something soothing about the simple up-and-down of dicing vegetables. Not unlike sketching magical formulas. Luna's quiet melody drifted over from where she stood, barely rising above the pot's soft simmer.

Through the kitchen window, I could see Ragnar's massive form curled in the garden, scales catching the late afternoon light. Father sat nearby, reading what looked like reports from the Council. The scene was peaceful, ordinary—yet something about it made my chest tight with an emotion I couldn't quite name.

"Nii-san, your mind's wandering down that rabbit hole again," Luna teased, giving me a playful shoulder bump. "These carrots won't judge your technique like those fussy spells of yours."

I looked down at my perfectly uniform cuts and shrugged. "There's nothing wrong with being precise."

Luna leaned over, examining my work. "They're all exactly the same size. It's a little creepy, honestly."

"Consistent heat distribution—" I started, then caught myself. *Not again.*

"See? Weirdo." She bumped my shoulder again, but the gesture was warm. Affectionate.

"Of course not," Mother interjected, though her eyes crinkled with amusement. "But dinner isn't meant to be an engineering challenge."

The kitchen gradually filled with the rich aroma of Mother's cooking. Soon Father joined us, drawn by the promise of a hot meal. Even Ragnar's massive head appeared at the window, golden eyes gleaming with interest.

"Perfect timing," Mother said, ladling the steaming stew into bowls. "Luna, would you get the bread?"

We settled around our old oak table, surface worn smooth from years of family meals. The golden-metal lamps overhead cast a warm glow across our faces. The cooking arrays hummed their quiet song beneath the casual conversation.

"Remember when Luna tried to 'improve' the bread-making array?" Father asked, tearing off a piece of crusty loaf. His eyes crinkled with amusement. "We had floating crumbs for days."

"That was an accident," Luna protested, but she was grinning. "Besides, some of my experiments worked out great. Remember the self-stirring soup pot?"

"The one that created a whirlpool in the kitchen?" I couldn't help adding. "Real success there."

Luna stuck her tongue out at me, but there was no heat in it. She reached for the salt. I noticed her hand trembling. Without thinking, I passed it to her before she could strain herself.

Our eyes met. In that moment, I saw both gratitude and stubborn pride warring in her expression. But then Mother started telling a story about her own childhood mishaps with crystal arrays, and the tension dissolved into laughter.

Ragnar's rumbling chuckle vibrated through the window glass as Father added his own memories, gesturing with a piece of bread. The evening light painted everything in soft gold. For a moment, all the worries about Luna's health, my own uncertainties, and the weight of expectations seemed to fade into the background.

Here, sharing bread and stories, we were just family—imperfect, sometimes frustrating, but always connected.

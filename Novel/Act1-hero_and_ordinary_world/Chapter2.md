
### Chapter 2

Vixia notices irregularities in the Luminar crystals' patterns and questions Luna's Array Circuit work. Luna dismisses Vixia's concerns while showing signs of physical strain. When Father arrives home, the family discusses Judgment Day and its historical significance. Mother and Syl eventually pull Luna away to help in the kitchen, while Vixia expresses worry about Luna's hidden condition to Father.

The Luminar crystals shimmered in their brass fixtures, their golden light spilling across the living room walls like woven threads in the quiet. I sat cross-legged by the hearth, chin resting in my hand, my gaze fixed on the faint flickers. To most, the glow would seem gentle and steady, a comforting rhythm. But I saw the pattern beneath the light—a pattern breaking. Each flicker carried a dissonance that burrowed into my thoughts, like a clock chiming out of time.

In my mind, the magic flow unraveled into crystalline shapes, sharp and precise. Input, process, output. The words whispered in my thoughts, a mantra I couldn’t quite source, the meaning just out of reach. It wasn’t logical, not entirely. It was instinct—an intuitive understanding that didn’t need explanation.

I reached out, brushing my fingers over the cool brass housing of the nearest crystal. A faint hum vibrated beneath my touch, the mana flow thrumming like a living heartbeat. “The circuit’s degrading,” I murmured, barely louder than the crystal’s pulse.

Behind me, Luna’s tools clinked steadily. The air carried the scent of polished brass and mana oil, mixing with the hearth’s warmth. Her movements were deft as ever, her hands a blur of precision as she adjusted the hexagonal array floating before her. Yet even in her fluid motions, I caught the faintest tremor, a subtle pause between adjustments that pulled at my attention.

I tilted my head, studying her work from the corner of my eye. “The Array Circuits feel off,” I said, louder than I meant to.

Luna’s hand froze mid-air. Slowly, she turned, her calm expression giving way to sharp eyes and a raised brow. “It’s balanced,” she said flatly, twisting a brass ring into place with deliberate force. Her words carried the unspoken challenge: *Are you doubting me?*

I hesitated, choosing my words carefully. “If you adjusted the alignment of the fourth crystal—”

“It’s fine,” she snapped, her voice firm but not unkind. That tone was her armor, polished for moments like these. She turned back to her array, her smirk a shield she wore with practiced ease. “Nii-san, if you want to finish this for me, be my guest. Otherwise…” She twisted the ring sharply, her smirk widening. “Let me work.”

The smirk said it all: *I’ve got this. Don’t interfere.* But I wasn’t looking at her smirk now—I was looking at the pallor of her cheeks, the tension in her movements. Her hand strayed briefly to her chest, a motion so quick it might have gone unnoticed. Not by me.

The creak of the door broke the moment.

Father stepped in, his coat dusted with frost and his boots clicking softly on the wooden floor. Snowflakes clung to his dark hair, catching the crystal light. His sharp green eyes swept the room, lingering first on Luna, then on me. Finding no immediate disaster, he let a quiet smile settle on his face.

“What’s this?” he teased, setting a steaming mug on Luna’s bench. “Another sibling rivalry?”

Luna straightened, brushing a strand of hair behind her ear. “It’s not a rivalry,” she said quickly, the edge in her voice fading. She twisted another ring, her smirk softening. “I already won.”

Father chuckled, leaning against the bench. “If you say so.”

Through the frost-speckled window, the jagged cliffs of the Raised Lands loomed against the twilight sky, their edges gleaming with crystalline scars left by Judgment Day. Beautiful but haunting, they stood as silent witnesses to everything we had lost—and everything we still didn’t understand.

The thought slipped out before I could stop it. “Do you ever think about what it must’ve been like? Standing against the beast, knowing you wouldn’t win?”

Luna’s hands froze for the briefest moment before resuming their work. “They weren’t fighting to win,” she said softly, her voice steady but distant. “They were desperate.”

Father crossed the room, placing a hand on Luna’s shoulder, his touch light but grounding. “Desperation doesn’t diminish courage,” he said gently. “It reveals it. Standing in the face of the impossible isn’t about winning—it’s about protecting what matters.”

Ragnar, curled by the hearth in his diminished form, shifted slightly, his obsidian-black scales absorbing the firelight. The faint glow of golden veins pulsed along his flank, their rhythm steady and reassuring. His molten gold eyes regarded me with quiet wisdom.

“Judgment Day taught us that even despair can hold power,” Ragnar rumbled, his deep voice filling the room. “Unity in adversity creates strength greater than any one individual.”

I nodded, the weight of his words settling over me. I had always admired the First Human Resonator, whose courage defied expectations. Their actions weren’t just history to me—they were the foundation of my dreams. One day, I wanted to stand as they had, to form a Resonance bond with a dragon and protect Esnar from the darkness that still threatened its edges.

Luna turned slightly, catching my gaze with a raised eyebrow. “You’re doing it again, Nii-san,” she said, her smirk softening into something warmer. “Getting all starry-eyed about history.”

I smiled faintly. “Maybe. But there’s nothing wrong with believing in what’s worth fighting for.”

Father chuckled, his eyes crinkling at the corners as he stepped away from Luna’s bench. “Ah, the Archi siblings—one dreaming of glory, the other inventing it. What a pair we’ve raised, Iruma.”

Mother’s voice drifted in from the hallway, light and melodic, with a faint teasing lilt. “And yet they both forget to wash up before dinner, no matter how brilliant they are.”

She entered the room with Syl padding beside her, the fox-like Vessel’s crystalline fur casting faint rainbows across the walls. Syl’s glowing eyes flicked toward Luna, its three tails swishing slowly as if in quiet observation.

Mother’s silvery-white hair shimmered in the crystal light, creating a soft halo around her as she shrugged off her shawl and hung it near the hearth. Her amber gaze swept the room, lingering on Luna’s workbench before settling on me. “Have you two been at it all evening?”

Luna straightened slightly, her smirk returning. “Nii-san’s been staring at crystals like they’re going to confess their secrets,” she said, gesturing vaguely toward the hearth.

“I’m observing,” I replied, though the defensiveness in my tone made Luna snicker.

Mother smiled faintly, but her gaze sharpened as it shifted back to Luna. “And you’ve been working long enough,” she said gently. “Come help me in the kitchen, Luna. Syl can finish keeping an eye on your array.”

Luna opened her mouth to protest but faltered when Syl hopped onto the bench beside her tools, its glowing tails curling protectively around the array. The Vessel’s silent gaze seemed to leave no room for argument, and Mother’s hand on Luna’s shoulder only reinforced the message.

“Fine,” Luna muttered, though she shot Syl an exaggeratedly suspicious look as she followed Mother out of the room. “Just don’t let it tinker with anything.”

I watched them go, noting the faint stiffness in Luna’s posture as she disappeared into the hallway. Syl tilted its head slightly, its luminescent eyes meeting mine briefly before turning back to the array.

“She’ll be fine,” Father said, his voice quiet but certain as he moved to sit near the hearth. Ragnar shifted slightly, lowering his head to rest on his massive foreclaw, though his molten gaze remained fixed on me.

“Will she?” I asked softly, more to myself than anyone else.

Father’s hand rested lightly on my shoulder. “Luna’s stronger than you think,” he said, his tone steady. “But strength isn’t about ignoring weakness—it’s about knowing when to rest and when to lean on others.”

I glanced toward the kitchen, where I could hear the soft clink of pots and pans, followed by Mother’s calm voice giving instructions. Luna’s replies were shorter, a little strained, though she still managed to sound playful when she teased Mother about over-seasoning.

“It’s not just her,” I said finally, my voice barely above a whisper. “She’s always pushing herself. And she’s hiding... something.”

Father didn’t reply immediately. Instead, he leaned back, watching the flicker of the flames in the hearth. “You’re observant, Vixia,” he said at last. “But sometimes what people need most isn’t someone to fix their problems—it’s someone to believe in their strength.”

I wanted to argue, to point out the growing frequency of Luna’s subtle gestures—her hand drifting to her chest, the pauses in her movements—but the weight of his words settled over me.

Ragnar’s deep voice rumbled softly, resonating through the room. “The greatest challenges are often those we cannot fight ourselves. Trust is as vital as courage, young one.”

I nodded, though the feeling of helplessness lingered, gnawing at the edges of my thoughts.

* * *

Mother and Luna prepare dinner together in the kitchen, with Luna measuring spices while learning about their magical properties. Vixia joins them reluctantly, helping with vegetables and checking the cooking array Luna modified. The family, including Father and Ragnar, gather for a peaceful dinner despite underlying tensions about Luna's health.

---

At the kitchen, Mother stood at the counter, her hands moving in practiced motions as she chopped vegetables, while Luna perched on a stool beside her, carefully measuring spices into small brass bowls.

"A pinch more thyme," Mother suggested, her amber eyes glowing faintly as she glanced at Luna's work. "Remember how it interacts with the rosemary?"

Luna's nose wrinkled in concentration. "Right—they amplify each other," she said, adjusting the measurement with surprising precision. "Like parallel circuits in an array."

Mother's laugh was soft and musical. "Trust you to find engineering in cooking." She paused her chopping to brush a strand of hair from Luna's face, her touch lingering for just a moment. "Though you're not wrong. Everything connects, in its own way."

"Does that mean I can experiment?" Luna asked, her eyes sparkling with familiar mischief. "Maybe add some crystal dust for extra flavor?"

"Absolutely not," Mother replied, but her stern tone was betrayed by her smile. "The last time you 'experimented' in the kitchen, we had floating dumplings for a week."

Luna grinned, unrepentant. "They were still delicious though."

I watched from the doorway as Luna measured another spice, her movements precise despite her playful demeanor. Mother worked beside her, her presence steady and calm, occasionally guiding Luna's hand or offering quiet suggestions. There was an ease between them, a gentle flow like perfectly aligned mana streams.

"The trick," Mother was saying, "is to let the flavors build naturally. You can't rush it, just like you can't rush an array's resonance."

Luna nodded, her expression softening into something more thoughtful. "Like waiting for the crystals to sync their frequencies?"

"Exactly." Mother's hand rested briefly on Luna's shoulder, squeezing gently. "Sometimes the most important part is having the patience to let things develop in their own time."

I shifted my weight against the doorframe, watching as Luna's fingers traced the edge of another spice jar. Her movements were precise, but I noticed the slight tremor in her hand as she lifted it. Before I could stop myself, I stepped forward.

"The coriander needs to be crushed first," I said quietly, reaching for the mortar and pestle. "It releases the oils better."

Luna's eyes narrowed. "I know that, Nii-san. I was getting to it."

"Here," Mother intervened smoothly, sliding the mortar toward Luna while giving me a knowing look. "Vixia's right about the technique, but I'm sure you remember from last time."

I felt heat rise to my cheeks, recognizing Mother's gentle correction. Always the mediator, she had a way of acknowledging both our perspectives without taking sides. Luna took the mortar with a small "hmph," but her movements as she crushed the seeds were careful, deliberate—exactly the way Mother had taught us.

The kitchen filled with the sharp, citrusy scent of the crushed coriander, mixing with the other spices and the rich aroma of simmering broth. From my vantage point by the window, I noticed the evening light glinting off Ragnar's scales as he napped in the garden, his enormous body coiled protectively around Father's cherished plants.

"Vixia," I heard Mother call me back, "could you see if the cooking array is at the right temperature? Luna changed it earlier, but I want to be sure it's staying consistent."

I nodded, feeling thankful for the task at hand. As I approached the stove, I sensed the shifts in the mana flow around me. It was like deciphering a code; each crystal's pulse revealed its own story. I had to give Luna credit—her modifications were smart. She had made the energy distribution more efficient than the original design, even if her approach was a bit...unusual.

"It's stable," I reported, resisting the urge to suggest improvements. Some battles weren't worth fighting, especially when the smell of dinner was making my stomach growl. I shifted my weight against the doorframe, watching as Luna's hands moved through the familiar motions of cooking. The way she handled spices reminded me of her engineering skills. She was precise and confident, but there was always a creative spark that made her uniquely Luna.

"You could come join us, Nii-san," Luna said without even glancing my way, "instead of just standing there like a broken security alarm."

Mother glanced over her shoulder, her smile warm and knowing. "There's plenty of work to go around."

I stepped into the kitchen, drawn by their invitation and the comfortable atmosphere. The scents of herbs and cooking filled the air, mingling with the subtle hum of the kitchen's crystal arrays. It was different from the workshop's sharp tang of mana oil and metal, but no less precise in its way.

"Here," Mother said, sliding a bowl of vegetables toward me. "These need to be diced. And Luna—"

"I know, I Know," Luna cut in, weighing out another seasoning with theatrical precision. "No testing my new spellwork in tonight's dinner."

I settled into the familiar task, letting the knife find its steady pattern. There was something soothing about the simple up-and-down of dicing vegetables, not unlike sketching magical formulas. Luna's quiet melody drifted over from where she stood, barely rising above the pot's soft simmer.

Through the kitchen window, I could see Ragnar's massive form curled in the garden, his scales catching the late afternoon light. Father sat nearby, reading what looked like reports from the Council. The scene was peaceful, ordinary—yet something about it made my chest tight with an emotion I couldn't quite name.

"Nii-san, Your mind's wandering down that rabbit hole again," Luna teased, giving me a playful bump. "These carrots won't judge your technique like those fussy spells of yours."

I looked down at my perfectly uniform cuts and shrugged. "There's nothing wrong with being precise."

"Of course not," Mother interjected smoothly, "but dinner isn't meant to be an engineering challenge."

The kitchen gradually filled with the rich aroma of Mother's cooking, and soon Father joined us, drawn by the promise of a hot meal. Even Ragnar's massive head appeared at the window, his golden eyes gleaming with interest.

"Perfect timing," Mother said, ladling the steaming stew into bowls. "Luna, would you get the bread?"

We settled around our old oak table, its surface worn smooth from years of family meals. The brass fixtures overhead cast a warm glow across our faces, and the cooking arrays hummed their quiet song beneath the casual conversation.

"Remember when Luna tried to 'improve' the bread-making array?" Father asked, tearing off a piece of crusty loaf. His eyes crinkled with amusement. "We had floating crumbs for days."

"That was an accident," Luna protested, but she was grinning. "Besides, some of my experiments worked out great. Remember the self-stirring soup pot?"

"The one that created a whirlpool in the kitchen?" I couldn't help adding. "Real success there."

Luna stuck her tongue out at me, but there was no heat in it. She reached for the salt, and I noticed her hand trembling slightly. Without thinking, I passed it to her before she could strain herself.

Our eyes met briefly, and in that moment, I saw both gratitude and stubborn pride warring in her expression. But then Mother started telling a story about her own childhood mishaps with crystal arrays, and the tension dissolved into laughter.

Ragnar's rumbling chuckle vibrated through the window glass as Father added his own memories, gesturing with a piece of bread. The evening light painted everything in soft gold, and for a moment, all the worries about Luna's health, my own uncertainties, and the weight of expectations seemed to fade into the background.

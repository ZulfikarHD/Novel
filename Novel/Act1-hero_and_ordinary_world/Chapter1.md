vixia half dead, losing one arm and tatterd body, collapse facing the ceiling in the dark cave, only the sound of dripping water can be heard, is this really the end this time ?

I lay in the darkness of the cave, my body a shattered shell of what it once was. The damp earth felt cold against my skin, and I could barely move. My left arm was gone—just a ragged edge where it used to be, a reminder of the foolishness that had brought me to this point. I stared up at the jagged stone ceiling, barely illuminated by the faint glow of bioluminescent fungi clinging to the walls. They flickered like distant stars in an endless night.

The only sound that broke the heavy silence was the relentless drip of water somewhere nearby, each drop echoing like a countdown to my final breath. With every heartbeat, I felt the weight of despair settle deeper into my chest, mingling with the bitter taste of iron in my mouth. It seemed this time was really the end for me.

I closed my eyes for a moment, willing myself to forget the agony that gripped me like a vice. Memories flickered through my mind: Luna’s laughter echoing in our workshop, her vibrant energy contrasting so starkly with this cold tomb. My heart ached for her, for all the moments we’d shared—moments now forever out of reach.

As I lay there, consciousness wavered on the edge like an old lantern sputtering in a gusty wind. I could feel fear creeping in, whispering its terrible truths about loneliness and loss.

The darkness around me pressed closer, thickening until it felt like a shroud. The drips continued their relentless rhythm—each one resonating with memories and regrets that weighed heavily on my heart. A bead of sweat trickled down my temple and mingled with blood from a gash on my forehead; even that felt distant and unimportant compared to the aching emptiness left by my tattered body.

I could only hear my rough breathing in the quiet cave. Each breath hurt, but it told me I was still alive - just barely. My thoughts turned to Luna. I had to laugh at how things turned out. She got her miracle, and I was happy for her. I could still hear her playful voice: "Nii-san, you should be looking at your own face! You still treat me like I'll break, even now. I'm actually stronger than you these days!"

Luna was right, as usual. She knew what she was talking about all along. When she got picked for the Covenant Horizon Academy, it just proved it even more. I can still see her big smile as she showed me that letter. Her blue eyes were bright and full of fun as she teased me, saying "Keep up, Nii-san!"

Now look at me. Blood fills my mouth, and I want to laugh and cry at the same time. Life can be so mean. I spent so many years trying to keep Luna safe, but here I am - hurt and alone in this dark part of Esnar. I just wanted to be by her side. I wanted to be good enough to call myself her brother. Was that asking too much?

As these thoughts drifted through my mind like scattered leaves, the cave's darkness began to blur and swirl, pulling me into its depths until consciousness slipped away like water through my fingers.

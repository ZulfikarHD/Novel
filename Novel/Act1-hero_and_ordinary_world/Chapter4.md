### Chapter 4

Vixia and Luna attend Ms. Lyra's Resonance studies class. Ms. Lyra explains that first summons serve as introductions to transcendent beings, who observe potential Resonators before forming link resonance. The class learns about compatibility requirements and how Resonance can help humans overcome their natural magical limitations.

As Luna and I made our way to Ms. Lyra's class, I found myself anticipating today's practical demonstration. Despite having read extensively about Resonance theory, seeing the actual principles demonstrated always revealed new insights. Luna, on the other hand, trudged along with noticeably less enthusiasm.

"I still don't get why this class is mandatory," she grumbled, adjusting her bag. "It's not like everyone's going to become a Resonator."

"Because understanding Resonance principles can improve other magical applications," I replied, falling into the familiar pattern of our debates. "Even your engineering could benefit from—"

"Leave it to you to find the practical angle, Nii-san," Luna cut me off with an eye roll, but I caught her slight smile.

The classroom door opened to a wash of gentle warmth, the ambient temperature always a few degrees higher than the hallway due to the active crystals Ms. Lyra used in her demonstrations. The familiar scent of sun-warmed brass and ozone filled the air—the telltale signature of recently activated Luminar arrays. Afternoon light streamed through the tall windows, catching dust motes that danced like tiny stars in its beam.

Ms. Lyra stood at the demonstration table, her black hair catching the light as she arranged an intricate pattern of crystals. Their soft pulses of light painted shifting shadows across the worn wooden floors, creating an almost hypnotic rhythm. Around us, other students settled into their seats, their whispered conversations creating a gentle buzz of anticipation. A few of them, I noticed, were already leaning forward, eyes fixed on the crystal arrangement—clearly, I wasn't the only one intrigued by today's setup.

"Today," Ms. Lyra announced, her voice carrying easily through the room, "we'll be examining the first summon ritual in greater detail. Most of you understand its basic purpose—attempting to establish initial contact with transcendent beings. However, today we'll explore one of the greatest mysteries that our scholars only recently began to unravel."

I straightened in my seat, feeling the familiar excitement building in my chest. Even after all my research, there was still so much unknown about Resonance. Beside me, Luna had slouched in her chair, but her pen was poised over her notebook—a sure sign she was at least partially interested.

Ms. Lyra touched one of the crystals, sending a ripple of golden light through the array. "For generations, we believed the first summon's overwhelming failure rate—99.9%—was simply the harsh reality of seeking transcendent links. Even the Vessels themselves rarely spoke of it, bound by laws and limitations we're only beginning to understand." She paused, letting the crystal's light cast intricate patterns across the ceiling. "But recent studies of successful Resonators have revealed something extraordinary."

The crystal's light pulsed stronger, forming shapes reminiscent of ethereal creatures. A collective gasp rose from the class. Even Luna's pen stilled.

"Each 'failed' attempt," Ms. Lyra continued, her voice filled with wonder, "leaves an echo in the transcendence realm. Like a fingerprint of the soul, unique to each person. Through careful research and rare testimonies from both Resonators and their Vessels, we've learned that transcendent beings can sense these echoes, allowing them to observe potential partners from their realm."

She adjusted the crystals, creating two distinct light patterns that danced around each other. "When a Vessel notices an echo that interests them, they may choose to observe the person more closely. This observation period can last anywhere from days to years. They watch how the person acts, how they handle challenges, how they treat others—everything that makes up their true nature."

"But Ms. Lyra," I ventured, connecting this with my previous studies, "why wouldn't the Vessels share this knowledge directly? Surely it would help potential Resonators understand the process better?"

A few heads turned my way, and I heard someone whisper, "Trust Archi to ask the complicated questions." But Ms. Lyra's eyes sparkled with approval.

"Another excellent question, Vixia. The transcendent realm operates under different laws than ours. Many Vessels are bound by restrictions we don't fully comprehend. They can guide us once linked, but cannot freely share certain knowledge about the nature of their realm or the link resonance process itself."

She gestured to where the two light patterns circled each other, never quite meeting. "But perhaps the most crucial aspect we've learned is about compatibility itself. It's not a choice—it's a fundamental resonance between souls. Even if both a Vessel and a potential Resonator desperately wish to link resonance, if their essences don't naturally align, the link simply cannot form. Think of it like two different musical notes—you can't force them to harmonize if they're fundamentally discordant."

The light patterns finally merged, creating a brilliant new color. "When true compatibility exists, the link forms naturally, like two perfectly matched notes creating a harmony. This is why some people might try for years without success, while others form links almost immediately. It's not about worthiness or effort—it's about finding that natural resonance."

Luna's hand shot up suddenly, her earlier disinterest forgotten. "So theoretically, if we could understand how these 'echoes' work, could we enhance them? Maybe through specialized crystal arrays?"

I glanced at my sister, recognizing the familiar glint in her eye—she'd found an engineering puzzle to solve. Around us, several students straightened, including Zain who practically bounced in his seat, clearly excited by the possibility. Even Elara, usually silent and observant, turned her piercing green eyes toward Luna with interest.

Ms. Lyra's expression turned thoughtful as she adjusted the crystal formation. The light patterns shifted again, creating a mesmerizing dance of geometric shapes. "An intriguing theory, Luna. However, attempts to artificially influence these echoes have proven... challenging. There are documented cases where such attempts actually diminished the chance of forming a bond."

"But why?" Zain burst out, unable to contain himself. His enthusiasm, as always, was infectious. "If we can understand it, shouldn't we be able to work with it?"

"Think of it like trying to make yourself more appealing by wearing a mask," Ms. Lyra explained, the crystals' light dimming slightly. "The very act of artificial enhancement might obscure the true essence that a Vessel seeks to observe."

I noticed Elara's slight nod at this explanation, her silvery hair catching the crystal light as she made a brief note in her notebook. Luna frowned, tapping her pen against her notebook—I could practically see the gears turning in her head, likely already formulating counter-arguments.

"Ms. Lyra," I began, choosing my words carefully, "the texts mention that human Resonators often achieve capabilities far beyond normal human limitations. But they're vague about how this actually works. Is it simply the Vessel's power flowing through us, or does something fundamentally change within the human Resonator?"

The crystal array pulsed with renewed intensity, as if responding to my question. Ms. Lyra smiled, her violet eyes reflecting the dancing lights. "Consider this," she said, adjusting the crystals to form a new pattern. Two lights began to orbit each other, their colors gradually blending where they intersected. "When a human forms a Resonance bond, it's not just about channeling the Vessel's power. The bond creates something entirely new—a synthesis of human adaptability and transcendent energy."

She gestured to where the lights had merged into a brilliant new color. "This is why human Resonators sometimes achieve things that surprise even their Vessels. Our very limitations, our need to understand and adapt, can lead to unprecedented applications of transcendent power."

The air hummed with a different frequency now, making the hair on my arms stand up. From the corner of my eye, I noticed Luna subtly pressing her hand against her chest, her breathing slightly labored. My concern must have shown on my face because she quickly straightened up, shooting me a warning glance.

"But," Ms. Lyra continued, her voice drawing my attention back to the demonstration, "this same adaptability makes the selection process crucial for Vessels. They must find partners whose natural essence—not just their abilities or ambitions—aligns with their own nature."

"What about the First Human Resonator?" Luna's voice cut through the quiet that had fallen over the classroom. "The texts say they formed multiple bonds—how does that fit with this matching process?"

The classroom fell silent. Even Zain stilled, his usual energy focused entirely on Ms. Lyra's response. Elara's gaze sharpened with interest.

Ms. Lyra's expression grew more serious, though her eyes retained their warm light. The crystal array shifted, its light dimming to a softer glow that cast long shadows across the room.

"Ah, now that touches on one of our greatest mysteries. The First Human Resonator possessed what we call Omni-Resonance—an ability so rare it's never been fully replicated. Their echo in the transcendence realm was said to be unique, capable of harmonizing with multiple Vessels simultaneously."

"Like a master instrument that can play any melody?" Zain interjected, practically vibrating with excitement.

Ms. Lyra smiled at his enthusiasm. "An apt metaphor, Zain. But remember," she cautioned, her voice gentle but firm, "extraordinary exceptions don't invalidate the general principle. Most successful Resonances come from genuine compatibility, not from trying to replicate exceptional cases."

"Then why even tell us about it?" Elara's quiet voice drew everyone's attention. Her green eyes reflected the crystal light as she continued, "If it's impossible to replicate, what's the purpose of studying it?"

"An excellent question." Ms. Lyra adjusted the crystal array again, creating a complex web of interconnected light patterns. "The First Human Resonator showed us what was possible—that humans, despite our perceived limitations, could achieve extraordinary things through Resonance. Their legacy isn't about replication, but about potential."

The air hummed with a different frequency now, making the hair on my arms stand up. From the corner of my eye, I noticed Luna subtly pressing her hand against her chest, her breathing slightly labored. My concern must have shown on my face because she quickly straightened up, shooting me a warning glance.

"Their achievement," Ms. Lyra continued, "also revealed something crucial about the nature of Resonance itself. The fact that one human could harmonize with multiple Vessels proved that compatibility isn't just about power or ability—it's about something far more fundamental in our nature."

A chime echoed through the halls—end of class. As students began gathering their things, their excited whispers filling the air, Ms. Lyra raised her voice slightly. "Remember, understanding these principles is crucial whether or not you pursue Resonance yourself. The same laws of compatibility and authentic connection apply to many aspects of magic."

As we packed up our bags, Luna nudged me. "Hey, Nii-san," she whispered, her eyes bright with that dangerous sparkle that usually meant she had an idea. "What if the problem isn't about enhancing the echo, but about understanding it better? Maybe if we could just—"

"Luna," I warned, recognizing the tone that usually preceded one of her more ambitious experiments.

"What?" She grinned, already pulling out her notebook. "I'm not saying we try to replicate Omni-Resonance. I'm just thinking about the observation process itself. If Vessels can observe us through these echoes, there must be some kind of... I don't know, pattern or principle we could study."

"Some things aren't meant to be engineered," Elara's soft voice came from behind us, making Luna jump slightly. "Sometimes observation itself changes what's being observed."

"But that's exactly my point!" Luna spun around, her earlier fatigue forgotten in her excitement. "If observation changes things, then understanding how and why—"

"Come on, Luna," I interrupted gently, noting how she was still pressing one hand against her chest despite her enthusiasm. "We'll be late for our next class."

Zain bounded up to us, grinning. "Late is better than never showing up! Besides, Luna might be onto something here. What if—"

"All of you," Ms. Lyra's voice carried from the front of the room, though her eyes twinkled with amusement, "should indeed head to your next class. Though I appreciate your enthusiasm for the subject."

As we filed out of the classroom, I couldn't help but notice how Luna's notebook was already filling with diagrams and calculations. Despite my concerns about her health, I felt a familiar warmth in my chest. My sister might dismiss Resonance studies as mandatory curriculum, but once her mind latched onto a puzzle, there was no stopping her.

I just hoped her latest idea wouldn't involve too many experimental arrays. We still hadn't fully repaired the scorch marks from her last "theoretical exploration."

* * *

I followed Luna out of Ms. Lyra's classroom, my mind still reeling from the discussion about Resonance. We made our way to the next class, our feet carrying us through the winding corridors of our school. The sun was high overhead, casting a warm glow over the campus. We were headed to a class on the Magic System, a subject I was both fascinated and intimidated by.

As we stepped out into the field, I felt a sense of excitement wash over me. The instructor, Mr. Kael, stood at the edge of the clearing, his eyes scanning the group. He was a tall, imposing figure with a kind face and a passion for teaching.

"Welcome, students," he boomed, his voice carrying across the field. "Today, we're going to explore the Magic System in a more hands-on way. We'll be working with Aether, the refined mana that powers our magic."

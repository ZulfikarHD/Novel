### Chapter 3

Vixia and Luna Archi prepare for their school day while their parents, Erwin and his wife, ready themselves for their own duties. Erwin heads to border patrol with Ragnar, while their mother works on ice array magic research. The family moves through their morning routine in their home on Esnar, where days span 36 hours.

The morning light filtered through the windows of the Archi household, casting soft glimmers across the intricately designed devices that lined the workbenches. I sat at the small table in the corner, hunched over a blueprint, my quill scratching against parchment as I tried to focus on the design I’d been working on. But the sounds around me kept tugging at my attention.

Luna burst into the kitchen, her bright blue eyes sparkling with mischief. “Nii-san, are you coming or not? We’ll be late for the school!” she called, her voice rich with energy. She swiped a piece of toast from the counter and shoved it into her mouth, crumbs falling as she darted back toward the door, her coat flaring out behind her like a cape.

“Just a moment!” I managed to reply, glancing quickly at the time. Esnar's long days made it easy to lose track; 36 hours felt both endless and fleeting in our routine. I looked again at the sketch before tucking it away. 

Mother was seated at her own table, her silvery-white hair gleaming. She carefully arranged her thesis notes while Syl floated nearby, observing her movements with almost playful grace. “I’m almost ready, love,” she said to Father, her voice soothing. “This discovery could change everything about how we harness ice array magic. I just need to double-check my equations.” 

“Take your time, my heart,” Father replied, appearing in the doorway with a warm smile. His high-collared coat hugged his broad shoulders, and I could see Ragnar just behind him, his immense figure silhouetted against the morning light. “But don’t delay too long. The border patrol waits for no one.”

Ragnar let out a low rumble, powerful yet calming. His molten gold eyes caught the light, flickering as he flexed his wings, readying himself for the day’s training. “Together, we’ll ensure the safety of our lands. But first, don’t forget your warm-up, Erwin,” he encouraged, the faint crackle of energy in his claws teasing the air.

I finished fastening my coat, peering over at Luna as she gathered her tools, unable to suppress a smile. Her excitement was infectious, and as chaotic as our mornings could be, there was a rhythm—an unspoken bond that wove through the Archi family as we all prepared for our respective days. 

“Let’s go! We can’t let them beat us to class again!” Luna’s voice rang out cheerfully, and with a final glance back at my parents and their tasks, I followed her outside, ready to tackle whatever the day at the academy might throw our way.

* * *

Vixia and Luna Archi attend an Advanced Array Configurations class where Mr. Aldrich announces a group project. The siblings are paired with Elara Frost and Zain Ember. The group develops an innovative design combining fractal patterns with rotational energy, though Luna shows signs of fatigue during the session.

---

The academy's grand halls buzzed with morning activity as Luna and I made our way to class. Despite being a year older, I found myself sharing classes with my sister - a fact that still drew curious glances from our classmates. Those two years I'd spent helping Father perfect his resonance techniques after Mother fell ill had delayed my enrollment, but they'd given me something else: countless hours watching energy flows, studying patterns, and developing an understanding of magical engineering that felt almost instinctive.

Luna's footsteps quickened as we approached the classroom, her usual boundless energy propelling her forward. She slid into her usual seat near the front, the morning light catching the slight shadows under her eyes - barely noticeable unless you knew to look for them. "Come on, Nii-san!" She patted the desk beside her, her smile bright but her fingers drumming a nervous pattern on the wooden surface. "Mr. Aldrich always starts exactly on time, and you know how he gets about tardiness."

The familiar scent of aged books and sun-warmed wood filled the air as I settled into my seat. A gentle hum of mana crystals resonated from the classroom's lighting arrays above - a sound that always reminded me of computer fans whirring, though I couldn't quite place why that comparison felt so natural.

Mr. Aldrich strode in, his crystalline monocle catching the morning light and casting prismatic patterns across his weathered face. He held up a Luminar crystal, its facets pulsing with a steady rhythm that made my fingers itch to trace its energy pathways. "Now, who can tell me the key principles of energy flow in a basic Array Circuit?"

Luna's hand shot up before he finished speaking, her sleeve pulling back just enough to reveal the faint tremor in her wrist - a detail that sent a familiar twist of worry through my chest. But her voice rang out clear and confident: "The primary crystal acts as the power source, like the heart of the system. Secondary crystals shape the array's purpose - think of them as specialized organs, each with their own role. The connecting etchings are like blood vessels, guiding the energy where it needs to go, while control runes..." She paused, taking a carefully measured breath that only I seemed to notice, "...direct everything like a conductor leading an orchestra, sir."

Her elbow nudged me gently, and I turned to find her eyes sparkling with that familiar mix of pride and challenge. The shadows under her eyes seemed deeper up close, but her grin was infectious. I knew that look - she was daring me to add something, to join her in this dance of knowledge we'd perfected over years of shared study.

Mr. Aldrich smiled, adjusting his monocle. "Excellent explanation, Miss Archi. Now, can anyone explain potential issues in more complex configurations?"

My hand rose almost of its own accord, even as my mind raced to organize the concepts that seemed to float just at the edge of consciousness. "In spiral arrays, sir," I began, watching as golden lines of energy danced across my vision in familiar patterns I couldn't quite place, "you might encounter recursive loops if the control runes aren't properly calibrated. It's similar to a..." I hesitated, a strange word - *programming* - hovering on my tongue. I swallowed it back, knowing it wouldn't make sense to anyone else. "...like a water wheel stuck in its cycle, sir."

The classroom fell silent. Mr. Aldrich's eyebrow arched with interest. "An unusual comparison, Mr. Archi. Please continue."

My fingers traced invisible patterns on my desk as I searched for words to explain what felt so clear in my mind, yet seemed to come from somewhere I couldn't quite remember. "Well, if you think of the energy flow like a sequence of steps," I sketched a quick diagram in the air, mana traces flickering briefly in its wake, "a miscalibrated rune could create an endless cycle. The energy keeps repeating the same pattern without achieving its purpose, draining the primary crystal dry."

Luna leaned closer, her breath catching slightly - another detail that made my heart clench. "Nice one, Nii-san," she whispered, her voice carrying a hint of strain beneath its usual playfulness. "You always have the strangest ways of explaining things, but they somehow make perfect sense."

I shrugged, the familiar weight of uncertainty settling on my shoulders. These insights that came so naturally - they felt like remembering something I'd never learned, using knowledge from a life I'd never lived. Sometimes, strange words and concepts would bubble up in my mind, making perfect sense to me but sounding foreign to everyone else.

Mr. Aldrich adjusted his monocle, studying my diagram with keen interest. "A rather... unconventional approach, Mr. Archi, but remarkably accurate. Though I must say, your analogies are quite unique."

As Mr. Aldrich continued his lecture, I found my mind wandering in that peculiar way it often did. The arrays and crystals he described seemed to rearrange themselves in my vision, like pieces of a puzzle shifting into more efficient patterns. Something about their flow felt wrong - like watching a melody played off-key.

Luna's hand shot up again, and I noticed how she braced her arm against the desk - a subtle movement that spoke volumes about her fatigue. "Sir, what about integrating fractal patterns into linear arrays? Couldn't that potentially amplify the output without increasing crystal load?"

The sparkle in her eyes couldn't quite mask the slight strain in her voice, but her mind was as sharp as ever. Mr. Aldrich's eyes lit up with interest, his monocle glinting in the morning light.

"An intriguing proposition, Miss Archi. How would you address the potential instability in such a configuration?"

As Luna launched into her explanation, my pen moved across paper almost on its own. Golden lines of energy danced in my mind, forming patterns that felt as natural as breathing yet as foreign as another language. Equations and diagrams flowed onto the paper, refining Luna's idea in ways that made perfect sense to me, even if I couldn't quite explain why.

"Nii-san," Luna whispered, her shoulder brushing mine as she leaned over. "What are you..." Her voice trailed off as she studied my notes, her brow furrowing in that way it did when she encountered something fascinating. The slight tremor in her hands had grown more noticeable, though she tried to hide it by gripping her pen tighter.

"I... I'm not sure," I admitted softly. "It just came to me."

Mr. Aldrich's voice cut through our whispered exchange. "Mr. Archi, would you care to share your thoughts with the class?"

The weight of expectant gazes pressed against me as I stood, clutching my notes. Luna gave me an encouraging nod, though I noticed how she used the moment to take a careful, measured breath - the kind she took when trying to gather strength.

"I was... expanding on Luna's idea, sir." My voice grew steadier as I focused on the familiar dance of energy patterns in my mind. "If we introduce a cascading resonance pattern here," I gestured to the board, trying to translate my strange intuition into terms they'd understand, "it would work like... like ripples in a pond, each wave supporting the next. The fractal integration stabilizes itself through these repeated patterns."

The classroom fell silent. Mr. Aldrich adjusted his monocle, studying my hastily sketched diagram with an intensity that made me want to sink back into my chair. The familiar anxiety crept up my spine until Luna's hand brushed against mine under the desk - a gesture of support that steadied me.

"This is... remarkably innovative, Vixia. Where did you learn this technique?"

Heat rose to my cheeks. "I didn't, sir. It just... made sense to me." Like so many things did, in ways I could never quite explain.

Luna beamed up at me, though I noticed how she leaned back in her chair, her shoulders tense with hidden exhaustion. "See? I told you you're brilliant, Nii-san. You just need to speak up more!"

As I sat back down, the weight of curious stares pressed against my back. Luna leaned in, her voice low and excited despite the slight catch in her breath. "We are so working on this later. I bet we could build a prototype!"

Mr. Aldrich cleared his throat, drawing attention back to the front of the room. "Now, I have an exciting announcement. We'll be starting a group project today."

The classroom erupted in a mix of groans and excited whispers. Luna's eyes met mine, a mischievous glint replacing the fatigue that had been creeping into them. I recognized that look - it usually preceded either brilliance or chaos, often both.

"Each team will consist of four students," Mr. Aldrich continued, the crystals in his monocle catching the morning light. "Your task will be to design and prototype a novel application of Array Circuits."

Luna's hand shot up, though I noticed how it trembled slightly before she steadied it against the desk. "Sir, can we choose our own teams?"

"No, Miss Archi. I'll be assigning the groups myself."

Luna turned to me, and despite the shadows under her eyes, her competitive spirit blazed bright. "Bet I can make a better prototype than you, Nii-san," she whispered, but her challenging tone couldn't quite mask the slight wheeze in her breath.

My chest tightened with familiar worry, but I played along, knowing how much she hated being coddled. "We'll see about that," I murmured back, already planning ways to suggest designs that wouldn't tax her too much.

Mr. Aldrich began calling out names. "Team One: Luna Archi, Vixia Archi..."

Luna's jaw dropped in theatrical surprise, and I couldn't help but smile at her expression. She recovered quickly, her determination shifting into something more collaborative. The tension in her shoulders eased slightly - whether from relief at working together or simple exhaustion, I couldn't tell.

"...Elara Frost and Zain Ember," Mr. Aldrich finished.

I glanced toward our new teammates. Elara sat near the window, her silvery hair catching the morning light in ways that reminded me of Luminar crystal refractions. Her sharp green eyes met mine with quiet intensity, and something in her gaze suggested she noticed more than she let on. When her attention shifted to Luna, her expression flickered with what might have been recognition - not of Luna herself, but perhaps of something in her careful movements.

Zain, by contrast, was all motion and energy. His wild red hair seemed to defy gravity as he pumped his fist in excitement, freckles dancing across his grinning face. "Yes! We got the Archi siblings!" he exclaimed, his voice carrying across the room. "This is gonna be awesome!"

"Yes! We got the Archi siblings!" Zain bounced up from his seat, wild red hair catching the morning light. "This is gonna be awesome!"

I felt a flutter of anxiety at his enthusiasm, but Luna seemed to feed off it, straightening in her seat despite her earlier fatigue. "Of course it will be," she declared, though I noticed how her hand pressed against the desk for support as she turned to face our new teammates. "We're going to make something incredible."

Elara raised an eyebrow, her voice soft but clear. "Perhaps we should discuss our approach first?" Her sharp green eyes flickered between Luna and me, lingering for a moment on Luna's white-knuckled grip on her desk. "I have some thoughts about energy conservation in spiral arrays."

Luna's expression tightened - the same look she got whenever someone suggested taking things slower. "We don't need to be that cautious. I was thinking we could-"

"Actually," I cut in, recognizing the stubborn set of Luna's jaw, "energy conservation might help with the stability issues in your fractal integration idea."

She shot me a glare, but the slight tremor in her hands betrayed her exhaustion. After a moment, she huffed. "Fine. But we're not playing it safe with everything."

As we huddled together, Zain practically vibrating with excitement beside us, I watched Luna's expression shift from reluctant to intrigued. Her initial resistance melted as Elara quietly outlined her ideas, each one building on Luna's original concept while making it more efficient.

"What if we made the array spin?" Zain blurted out suddenly, his hands whirling through the air. "Like, physically spin!"

Luna paused mid-sentence, her pen hovering over her notebook. A snort escaped before she could catch it. "Zain, arrays don't..." she started, then stopped, her eyes widening. I recognized that look - the one that meant her mind was racing ahead, seeing possibilities others might miss.

"Actually," Elara's soft voice cut through Luna's contemplation, "rotational energy could enhance mana flow in certain configurations."

Luna's head snapped up. "Wait, really?" Her earlier fatigue seemed forgotten as she leaned forward, eyes bright. "Nii-san, wouldn't that work with your ripple theory from earlier?"

I blinked, surprised by her sudden enthusiasm. The familiar patterns danced in my mind, rearranging themselves with this new possibility. "It... might actually stabilize the whole system," I admitted, already sketching out the concept.

"Ha!" Luna's triumphant grin carried a hint of her usual competitiveness. "See? Sometimes the weird ideas are the best ones." She paused, glancing at my growing diagram. "Though your layout needs work. Here-" She reached for my paper, then stopped, her hand trembling slightly.

Elara smoothly slid her own notebook forward. "Perhaps we could combine both approaches?" Her calm suggestion drew attention away from Luna's moment of weakness - something about her manner suggested it wasn't entirely coincidental.

Zain leapt from his seat, nearly knocking over his chair. "Yes! Spinning arrays for the win!" he shouted, drawing curious stares from nearby groups.

Mr. Aldrich cleared his throat from across the room. "Mr. Ember, please contain your enthusiasm to a more... classroom-appropriate level."

"Sorry, sir!" Zain grinned, not looking sorry at all as he plopped back into his seat. His energy seemed to fill our corner of the classroom, making even Elara's lips twitch into a slight smile.

As we delved deeper into our design, something felt different. Each time I started to hesitate over a calculation, Luna would click her tongue impatiently. "Just draw it already, Nii-san," she'd mutter, though her eyes tracked my movements with keen interest.

I sketched out another modification, and Luna leaned forward, her breath catching slightly. She pressed her palm flat against the desk - a gesture I recognized as her way of steadying herself. Her eyes narrowed at my diagram, and for a moment, I thought she'd dismiss it.

"That's..." she started, then pressed her lips together. "Actually not terrible." The words came out reluctantly, but there was a glimmer of pride in her eyes before she quickly looked away. "Though if we adjusted the flow here-" Her hand trembled as she reached for the paper.

Elara's quiet voice cut in smoothly. "What if we combined that with a stabilizing matrix?" She slid her notebook closer to Luna, providing support for her shaking hand without drawing attention to it. "Like this?"

Luna's shoulders relaxed slightly, though her competitive spirit flickered back to life. "That could work, but watch this-" She began sketching rapidly, her strokes confident despite her fatigue.

Zain bounced in his seat, scattering papers. "Oh! And if we add another crystal here-" he jabbed at the diagram, his enthusiasm making Luna snatch the paper away protectively.

"Careful! You'll smudge the-" She broke off, her breath hitching. For a moment, her face paled.

I reached for her arm, but she shot me a warning look. *Don't you dare*, it said clearly. Instead, I pointed to a section of her design. "The energy flow might be too intense there," I said quietly. "What if we redistributed it through these secondary nodes?"

She stared at me for a moment, understanding flickering across her face. "Fine," she muttered, though her grip on the pencil loosened slightly. "But we're keeping the core design."

Elara's observant gaze moved between us, her expression thoughtful. "The secondary nodes could actually enhance the rotation effect," she offered, her soft voice carrying a note of gentle approval. "Especially if we layer them like this-" Her elegant script filled the margins of our diagram, adding depth to our concept without overwhelming it.

Our group fell into a rhythm after that. Luna's brilliant ideas would spark a direction, Zain's wild enthusiasm would push boundaries, Elara's careful refinements would make them possible, and my strange intuitions would tie it all together. When Luna's energy would flag, Elara would mysteriously need time to double-check calculations, or Zain would burst into another excited tangent, giving her moments to recover without acknowledging them.

"You know," Luna said during one such pause, her voice carrying a mix of reluctance and pride, "this might actually be better than what I would have done alone." She glanced at me, adding quickly, "Don't let it go to your head, Nii-san."

I sketched out another modification, my hand pausing briefly over a complex intersection point. Luna leaned forward, her breath catching slightly. She pressed her palm flat against the desk - a gesture I'd seen countless times when she needed to steady herself. Her eyes narrowed at my diagram, and I found myself wanting to redraw it.

"That's..." she started, then pressed her lips together. "Actually not terrible." The words came out reluctantly, but there was a glimmer in her eyes before she quickly looked away. "Though if we adjusted the flow here-" Her hand trembled as she reached for the paper.

Elara's quiet voice cut in smoothly. "What if we combined that with a stabilizing matrix?" She slid her notebook closer to Luna, providing support for her shaking hand without drawing attention to it. "Like this?"

Luna's shoulders relaxed slightly, though her competitive spirit flickered back to life. "That could work, but watch this-" She began sketching rapidly, her strokes confident despite her fatigue.

Zain bounced in his seat, scattering papers. "Oh! And if we add another crystal here-" he jabbed at the diagram, his enthusiasm making Luna snatch the paper away protectively.

"Careful! You'll smudge the-" She broke off, her breath hitching. For a moment, her face paled.

My hand moved toward her arm before I caught myself. Luna shot me a warning look that could have frozen a fire crystal. Instead, I pointed to a section of her design. "The energy flow might be too intense there," I said quietly. "What if we redistributed it through these secondary nodes?"

She stared at me for a moment, something unspoken passing between us. "Fine," she muttered, though her grip on the pencil loosened slightly. "But we're keeping the core design."

Elara's observant gaze moved between us, her expression thoughtful. "The secondary nodes could actually enhance the rotation effect," she offered, her soft voice carrying a note of gentle approval. "Especially if we layer them like this-" Her elegant script filled the margins of our diagram, adding depth to our concept without overwhelming it.

Strange patterns danced in my mind as we worked, like fragments of a half-remembered dream. Each time I started to question them, Luna would make an impatient sound or Zain would burst into another excited tangent, pulling me back into the flow of creation. When Luna's energy would flag, Elara would mysteriously need time to double-check calculations, or Zain would launch into elaborate theories about spinning crystals, giving her moments to recover without acknowledging them.

"You know," Luna said during one such pause, her voice carrying a mix of reluctance and pride, "this might actually be better than what I would have done alone." She glanced at me, adding quickly, "Don't let it go to your head, Nii-san."

The morning light shifted across our desks as we refined our design. Luna's breathing grew more labored, though she tried to hide it behind excited explanations and sharp critiques. Each time I opened my mouth to suggest a break, she'd cut me off with a new idea or a challenging glare.

Elara caught my eye, her sharp green gaze flickering to Luna and back. Without a word, she began gathering her notes. "Perhaps we should organize our documentation for next class," she suggested softly. "Mr. Aldrich will want a detailed progress report."

Luna started to protest, but Zain's enthusiastic agreement drowned her out. "Oh man, we need to make this presentation amazing! Maybe we could make the diagrams spin too!"

As the others packed up their materials, Luna's shoulders sagged slightly. "This was... not terrible," she admitted, her voice low enough that only I could hear. "Your weird ideas actually helped." She paused, straightening her papers with careful precision. "Just... don't start doubting them again, okay? It's annoying."

Before I could respond, she'd already turned away, but her words lingered in the air between us - half challenge, half something else entirely.

The classroom buzzed with activity as other groups began wrapping up their discussions. Mr. Aldrich moved between tables, his monocle glinting as he reviewed each team's progress. When he reached our group, his eyebrows rose at our diagram.

"Most... intriguing," he murmured, studying the complex array of spinning patterns and fractal integrations. "Though I must admit, some of these configurations are rather unorthodox." His gaze lingered on my sketches, head tilting slightly.

Luna straightened in her seat, her exhaustion momentarily masked by pride. "The unorthodox parts are what make it brilliant, sir." She shot me a quick glance. "Even if the explanations behind them are weird."

"Indeed," Mr. Aldrich adjusted his monocle. "I look forward to seeing your prototype. Remember, you'll need to demonstrate a working model by next week."

As he moved away, Luna's confident posture wavered slightly. She pressed one hand against the desk, using the motion of gathering her papers with the other to hide how she steadied herself.

"We should meet to start building tomorrow," she declared, though her voice carried a slight tremor. "The sooner we-"

"The workshop will be crowded tomorrow," Elara interrupted smoothly. "Perhaps the day after? That would give us time to properly source the materials we need."

Luna's eyes narrowed, but before she could argue, Zain bounced up from his seat. "Oh! And I can ask my uncle about getting some higher-grade crystals! He works at the Harmonic Foundries, you know. Though it might take a day or two..."

I watched Luna's expression shift from frustration to reluctant acceptance. She couldn't argue against better materials, even if it meant waiting.

"Fine," she conceded, stuffing her notes into her bag with more force than necessary. "But we're not wasting any time once we start. This has to be perfect."

The morning bell chimed, its resonant tone signaling the end of class. As students filed out, Luna lingered, her movements deliberately slow. I pretended to be absorbed in organizing my papers, waiting.

"Stop hovering," she muttered, but didn't move away. "I'm fine."

"I know," I replied, though my eyes caught the slight tremor in her fingers as she closed her bag. "I just want to make sure I didn't forget any notes."

She snorted, seeing through the excuse easily. "Your weird array ideas are already memorized in that strange head of yours." Her tone was sharp, but as she stood, she let her shoulder brush against mine - a brief moment of contact that said more than her words. "Just make sure you actually use them when we build this thing. I hate it when you..." she trailed off, shaking her head. "Never mind. Come on, we'll be late for resonance practice."

As we left the classroom, I noticed Elara watching us from the doorway, her piercing green eyes thoughtful. She nodded once, a gesture that seemed to carry understanding beyond simple farewell, before disappearing into the crowd of students.

Luna's pace was slower than usual as we navigated the busy hallway, though she covered it well with sharp comments about our classmates' project ideas. I matched her stride without comment, letting her words fill the space between us.

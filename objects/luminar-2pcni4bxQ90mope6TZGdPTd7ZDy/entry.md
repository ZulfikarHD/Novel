Luminar is the refined essence of raw Mana, transformed through a natural or artificial process. Think of it as the "distilled" form of magical energy.

**Natural Formation Process:**
1. **Deep Earth Formation**
   - Raw Mana pools in underground caverns
   - Exposed to natural Ethereal energy currents
   - Crystallizes over centuries
   - Forms pure, natural Luminar Stones
2. **Atmospheric Formation**
   - Occurs during rare celestial events
   - Mana condenses in high-altitude areas
   - Creates "Skyborn" Luminar Stones
   - These are typically more potent but smaller

**Artificial Production:**
1. **Harmonic Foundries Process**
   - Raw Mana is collected in resonance chambers
   - Stone Singers use specialized chants to initiate crystallization
   - Process takes months instead of centuries
   - Results in lower-grade but usable stones
